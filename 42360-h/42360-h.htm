<h2>THE FORTY-SECOND PSALM.</h2>

<p class="center">Â¶ <em>To the Chief Musician</em>, <span class="smcap">Maschil</span>, <em>for the Sons of Korah.</em></p>

<p>
1  As the hart panteth after the water-brooks,&mdash;so panteth my soul after thee, O God.<br />
<br />
2  My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:&mdash;when shall I come and appear before God?<br />
<br />
3  My tears have been my meat day and night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?</span><br />
<br />
4  When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With the voice of joy and praise,&mdash;with a multitude that kept holy day.</span><br />
<br />
5  Why art thou cast down, O my soul?&mdash;and why art thou disquieted in me?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For the help of his countenance [or, His presence is salvation].</span><br />
<br />
6  O my God, my soul is cast down within me:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From the hill Mizar.</span><br />
<br />
7  Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy water-spouts;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.</span><br />
<br />
8  Yet the Lord will command his loving-kindness in the day-time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And in the night his song shall be with me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And my prayer unto the God of my life.</span><br />
<br />
9  I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</span><br />
<br />
10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">While they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?</span><br />
<br />
11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul?&mdash;and why art thou disquieted within me?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him,</span><br />

<p>The following is an excellent poetical paraphrase
of the Psalm, by Bishop Lowth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"On briny tears my famish'd soul hath fed,</div>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Oft dwell my thoughts on those thrice happy days,</div>
<div class="indent1">When to Thy fane I led the willing throng;</div>
<div class="line">Our mirth was worship, all our pleasure praise,</div>
<div class="indent1">And festal joys still closed with sacred song.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Why throb, my heart? why sink, my saddening soul,</div>
<div class="indent1">Why droop to earth, with various foes oppress'd?</div>
<div class="line">My years shall yet in blissful circles roll,</div>
<div class="indent1">And peace be yet an inmate of this breast.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"By Jordan's banks with devious steps I stray,</div>
<div class="indent1">O'er Hermon's rugged rocks and deserts dear:</div>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"In rapid floods the vernal torrents roll,</div>
<div class="indent1">Harsh sounding cataracts responsive roar;</div>
<div class="line">Thine angry billows overwhelm my soul,</div>

<div class="line">"Yet Thy sure mercies ever in my sight,</div>

</div>

<p>"The spot was so attractive to me, as well as the view of the
surrounding country so charming, that I had great difficulty in
tearing myself away from it. In the foreground, at my feet, was
the Jordan flowing through its woods of tamarisks. On the other
side rose gently the plain of Beisan surmounted by the high <em>tell</em>
of that name. In the distance were the mountains of Gilboa&mdash;the
whole stretch of which is seen, even as far as ancient Jezreel."&mdash;<cite>Van

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">&nbsp;</a></span></p></blockquote>


<h2>I.</h2>

<h3>THE SCENE OF THE PSALM.</h3>

<p>All recent explorers of Palestine speak in glowing
terms of that "solemn eastern background," with
its mellow tints of blue and purple, rising conspicuous,
as if a wall built by giants, from the deep
gorge or valley of the Jordan. This mountain range,
and especially the hills of Gilead, with their rugged
ravines and forests of sycamore and terebinth, are
full of blended memories of joy and sadness. From
one of these slopes, the Father of the Faithful
obtained his first view of his children's heritage.
On another, the Angels of God&mdash;the two bright
celestial bands&mdash;greeted Jacob on his return from
his sojourn in Syria.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> From another, trains of wailing
captives on their way to Babylon, must oft and
again have taken through their tears their last look
of "the mountains round about Jerusalem." Nigh
the same spot, the footsteps of our blessed Redeemer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Himself lingered, when death was hovering over the
couch of the friend He loved at Bethany. Martha
and Mary, from their Village-home, must have lifted
their eyes to these same "hills," from whence they
knew, in the extremity of their anguish, their "help"
alone could come. While, at a later period, the
same spot was rendered illustrious as the locality
of <em>Pella</em>, the mountain fortress and asylum whither
their Lord had admonished His followers to flee,
when the Imperial Eagles of Rome were gathered
by Titus around the devoted city.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This "land beyond the Jordan" still further derives
an imperishable interest from being the exile-retreat
of the sweet Singer of Israel in the most pathetic
period of his chequered life and reign. There
is no more touching episode in all Hebrew history
than the recorded flight of David from his capital
on the occasion of the rebellion of Absalom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the defection of his people. Passing, barefoot and
weeping, across the brook Kedron, and thence by
the fords of Jericho, he sped northwards with his
faithful adherents, and found a temporary shelter
amid these remote fastnessess.</p>

<p>Minds of a peculiar temperament have often found
it a relief, in seasons of sadness, to give expression
to their pent-up feelings in poetry or song. Ancient
as well as modern verse and music abound with
striking examples of this,&mdash;"Songs in the Night,"
when the mouldering harp was taken down from
the willows by some captive spirit, and made to
pour forth its strains or numbers in touching
elegy. David's own lament for Jonathan is a gush
of intensified feeling which will occur to all, and
which could have been penned only in an agony of
tears.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It was a spirit crushed and broken with other,
but not less poignant sorrows, which dictated this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Psalm of his exile. May we not imagine that, in
addition to the tension of feeling produced by his
altered fortunes, there was in the very scene of his
banishment, where the plaintive descant was composed,
much to inspire poetic sentiment? The alternate
calm and discord of outer nature found their
response in his own chequered experiences. Nature's
Ãolian harp&mdash;its invisible strings composed of
rustling leaves and foaming brooks, or the harsher
tones of tempest and thunder, flood and waterfall&mdash;awoke
the latent harmonies of his soul. They furnished
him with a key-note to discourse higher melodies,
and embody struggling thoughts in inspired
numbers. In reading this Psalm we at once feel
that we are with the Minstrel King, not in the
Tabernacle of Zion, but in some glorious "House
not made with hands,"&mdash;some Cathedral whose
aisles are rocky cliffs and tangled branches, and its
roof the canopy of Heaven!</p>

<p>Let us picture him seated in one of those deep
glens listening to the murmur of the rivulet and
the wail of the forest. Suddenly the sky is overcast
Dark clouds roll their masses along the
purple peaks. The lightning flashes; and the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
oaks and terebinths of Bashan bend under the tumult
of the storm. The higher rivulets have swelled the
channel of Jordan,&mdash;"deep calls to deep"&mdash;the waves
chafe and riot along the narrow gorges. Suddenly a
struggling ray of sunshine steals amid the strife, and
a stray note from some bird answers joyously to its
gleam. It is, however, <em>but</em> a gleam. The sky again
threatens, fresh bolts wake the mountain echoes.
The river rolls on in augmented volume, and the
wind wrestles fiercely as ever with the denizens of
the forest. At last the contest is at an end. The
sky is calm&mdash;the air refreshed&mdash;the woods are vocal
with song&mdash;ten thousand dripping boughs sparkle
in the sunlight; the meadows wear a lovelier
emerald; and rock, and branch, and floweret, are
reflected in the bosom of the stream.</p>

<p>As the royal spectator with a poet and painter's
eye is gazing on this shifting diorama, and when
Nature is laughing and joyous again amid her own
tear-drops, another simple incident arrests his attention.
A Hart or Deer, hit by the archers or pursued
by some wild beast on these "mountains of the
leopards," with hot eyeballs and panting sides,
comes bounding down the forest glade to quench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the rage of thirst. The sight suggests nobler aspirations.
With trembling hand and tearful eye the
exiled spectator awakes his harp-strings, and bequeaths
to us one of the most pathetic musings in
the whole Psalter. The 23d has happily been called
"the nightingale of the Psalms;" this may appropriately
be termed "the turtle-dove." We hear the
lonely bird as if seated on a solitary branch warbling
its "reproachful music," or rather struggling
on the ground with broken wing, uttering a doleful
lament. These strains form an epitome of the Christian
life&mdash;a diary of religious experience, which,
after three thousand years, find an echo in every
heart. Who can wonder that they have smoothed
the death-pillow of dying saints, and taken a thorn
from the crown of the noble army of martyrs!<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<h2 class="oldenglish">The General Scope of the Psalm.</h2>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">"Like unto ships far off at sea,</div>
<div class="line">Outward or homeward bound are we:</div>
<div class="line">Before, behind, and all around</div>
<div class="line">Floats and swings the horizon's bound;</div>
<div class="line">Seems at its outer rims to rise,</div>
<div class="line">And climb the crystal wall of the skies;</div>
<div class="line">And then again to turn and sink,</div>
<div class="line">As if we could slide from its outer brink.</div>
<div class="line">Ah! it is not the sea that sinks and shelves,</div>
<div class="line">But ourselves</div>
<div class="line">That rock and rise</div>
<div class="line">With endless and uneasy motion&mdash;</div>

</div></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Scriptures have laid a flat opposition between faith and
sense. We live by faith and not by sense. They are two buckets&mdash;the
life of faith and the life of sense; when one goes up, the
other goes down."&mdash;<em>Bridge</em>, 1637.</p>

<p>"There are twins striving within me; a Jacob and an Esau.
I can, through Thy grace, imitate Thy choice, and say with
Thee, <em>Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated</em>. Blessed God!
make Thou that word of Thine good in me, that <em>the elder shall
serve the younger</em>."&mdash;<em>Bishop Hall</em>, 1656.</p></blockquote>


<h2>II.</h2>

<h3>THE GENERAL SCOPE OF THE PSALM.</h3>

<p>"If the Book of Psalms be, as some have styled
it, a mirror or looking-glass of pious and devout
affections, this Psalm, in particular, deserves as
much as any one Psalm to be so entitled, and is
as proper as any other to kindle and excite such
in us. Gracious desires are here strong and fervent;
gracious hopes and fears, joys and sorrows, are
here struggling. Or we may take it for a conflict
between sense and faith; sense objecting, and faith
answering."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In these few words, the Father of commentators,
with his wonted discernment, has given us the key to
the true interpretation of this sacred song. It may
be regarded, indeed, as the Old Testament parallel
to the 7th chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, in
which another inspired writer truthfully and powerfully
portrays the same great struggle between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
corruption and grace, faith and sense, "the old and
the new man."</p>

<p>There are two antagonist principles in the heart
of every believer, corresponding to the great forces
which act in the material world. The tendency of
his new nature is to gravitate towards God&mdash;the
Divine Sun of his being&mdash;the centre of his fondest
affections&mdash;the object of his deepest love. But
"there is a law in his members warring against the
law of his mind;"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;the remains of his <em>old</em> nature,
leading him to wander in wide and eccentric orbit
from the grand Source of light, and happiness, and
joy! "<em>What will ye see in the Shulamite?</em>"
asks the Spouse in the Canticles, personating the
believer (at a time, too, when conscious of devoted
attachment to the Lord she loved). The reply
is, "<em>As it were the company of two armies</em>." (Sol.
Song vi. 13.) Sight on the one hand, Faith on the
other. The carnal mind, which is enmity against
God, battling with the renewed spiritual mind,
which brings life and peace. Affections heaven-born,
counteracted and marred by affections earth-born.
The magnet would be true to its pole but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
for disturbing moral influences. The eagle would
soar, but it is chained to the cage of corruption.
The believer would tread boldly on the waves, but
unbelief threatens to sink him. He would fight
the battles of the faith, but there is "a body of
death" chained to his heavenly nature, which compels
him to mingle denunciations of himself as "a
wretched man" with the shouts of victory.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>We may imagine David, when he composed
this Psalm, wrapped in silent contemplation&mdash;the
past, the present, and the future suggesting
mingled reflections. The shepherd, the king, the
fugitive! Sad comment on the alternations of
human life! humbling lesson for God's Anointed!
It furnishes him with a true estimate of the world's
greatness. It has taught him the utter nothingness
of all here as a portion for the soul. Amid outward
trial and inward despondency, <span class="smcap">Faith</span> looks to
its only true refuge and resting-place. His truant
heart softened and saddened by calamity, turns to
its God,&mdash;"<em>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks,
so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<em>when shall I come and appear before God?</em>" (Ver.
1, 2.) But the wave is beaten back again! He
remembers his sins and his sorrows, and (more
galling to his sensitive spirit) the taunts of ungodly
scoffers. "<em>My tears have been my meat day and
night, while they continually say unto me, Where
is thy God?</em>" (Ver. 3.) Moreover, he is denied the
solace of public ordinances. He can no longer, as
once he could, light the decaying ashes of his
faith at the fires of the altar. Memory dwelt
with chastened sadness on the hours of holy convocation.
"<em>When I remember these things, I
pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the
multitude; I went with them to the house of God,
with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude
that kept holy-day.</em>" (Ver. 4.) But, once more, the
new-born principle regains the mastery. He rebukes
his own unbelief, urges renewed dependence on
God, and triumphs in the assurance of His countenance
and love. "<em>Why art thou cast down, O
my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope
thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help
of his countenance.</em>" (Ver. 5.) But again the harp
is muffled! <em>Unbelief</em> musters her ranks; fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
remembrances of sin and sorrow crowd upon him.
"<em>O my God, my soul is cast down within me.</em>"
(Ver. 6.) <em>Faith</em>, however, has its antidote at hand,
and the momentary cause of depression is removed.
The memory of former succours and mercies inspires
with confidence for the future, and he immediately
adds, "<em>I will remember</em> <span class="smcap">Thee</span> (in this the place of
my Exile) <em>from the land of Jordan, and of the
Hermonites, from the hill Mizar</em>."</p>

<p>But the storm-clouds are still wreathing his sky;&mdash;nay,
it seems as if the tempest were deepening.
Fresh assaults of temptation are coming in upon
him;&mdash;there seems no light in the cloud, no ray in
the darkness. "<em>Deep calleth unto deep at the noise
of thy water-spouts; all thy waves and thy billows
are gone over me.</em>" (Ver. 7.) But again, his own
extremity is God's opportunity; Faith is seen
cresting the resurgent waves. Lifting his voice
above the storm, he thus expresses his assurance in
God's faithfulness, "<em>Yet the Lord will command his
loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night
his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the
God of my life</em>." (Ver. 8.) Nay, he resolves in all
time to come to provide against the return of seasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of guilty distrust and misgiving. He dictates and
transcribes the very words of a prayer to be employed
as an antidote in any such recurring moments
of despondency. He resolves to rise above frames
and feelings, and to plant his feet on the Rock
of Ages, which these fluctuating billows can never
shake;&mdash;"<em>I will say unto God my rock, Why hast
thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because
of the oppression of the enemy?</em>" (Ver. 9.) The
Old nature makes one last and final effort, ere abandoning
the conflict. Unbelief rallies its strength. A
former assault is renewed. "<em>As with a sword in
my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say
daily unto me, Where is thy God?</em>" (Ver. 10.) But he
reverts to his prayer! He adopts his own liturgy for
a time of sorrow. "<em>Why art thou cast down, O my
soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope
thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him.</em>" (Ver. 11.)
He seems to be "answered while yet speaking;" for
he closes with the joyful declaration, "<em>Who is the
health of my countenance, and my God</em>." (Ver. 11.)
He had made a similar assertion in a former verse
(Ver. 5), "<em>I shall yet praise him for the help of his
countenance</em>;" but now he can add the language of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
triumphant assurance, "My God!" The conflict is
ended;&mdash;sense quits the field, and faith conquers.
He began the Psalm in trouble, he ends it with joy.
Its notes throughout are on the minor key, but
these merge at last into a strain of triumph. He
began comparing himself to the stricken deer&mdash;the
helpless, breathless, panting fugitive;&mdash;he ends it
with angel's words,&mdash;with the motto and watchword
in which a seraph might well glory&mdash;heaven knows
no happier&mdash;"<span class="smcap">My God</span>!"</p>

<p>"He looked," says Matthew Henry, "upon the
living God as his chief good, and had set his heart
upon Him accordingly, and was resolved to live
and die by Him; and casting anchor thus at first,
he rides out the storm."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>O child of God! touchingly expressive picture
have we here of the strange vicissitudes in thy
history. The shuttle in the web of thy spiritual
life, darting hither and thither, weaving its chameleon
hues; or, to adopt a more appropriate emblem,
thy heart a battle-field, and "no discharge in that
war" till the pilgrim-armour be exchanged for the
pilgrim-rest:&mdash;sense and sin doing their utmost to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
quench the bivouac-fires of faith, and give the
enemy the advantage: ay, and they <em>would</em> succeed
in quenching these, did not the Lord of pilgrims
feed with the oil of His own grace the languishing
flame. "Sometimes," it has been well said, "in the
Voyages of the Soul, we feel that we can only go
by anxious soundings,&mdash;the compass itself seeming
useless&mdash;not knowing our bearings,&mdash;nearing here
Christ&mdash;then perhaps the dim tolling bell amidst
the thick darkness warning us to keep off."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> But
fear not; He will "bring you to the haven where
ye would be." The voice of triumph will be heard
high above the water-floods. The contest may be
long, but it will not be doubtful. He who rules
the raging of the sea will, in His own good time,
say, "Peace, be still, and immediately there will
be a great calm." Have you ever watched the
career of the tiny branch or withered leaf which
has been tossed into a little virgin rill on one
of our high-table lands or mountain moors? For a
while, in its serpentine course, it is borne sluggishly
along, impeded by protruding moss, or stone, or
lichen. Now it circles and saunters hither and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
thither on the lazy streamlet&mdash;now floating back
towards the point of departure, as if uncertain which
direction to choose. A passing breath of wind carries
it to the centre, and the buoyant rivulet sings its way
joyously onward, bearing its little burden through
copse, and birch, and heather. But again it is obstructed.
Some deep inky pool detains it in the
narrow ravine. There it is sucked in, whirled and
twisted about, chafed and tortured with the conflict
of waters; or else it lies a helpless prisoner, immured
by the rocks in their fretting caldrons. But by and
by, with a new impulse it breaks away along the
rapid torrent-stream, bounding over cascade and
waterfall, home to its ocean destiny.</p>

<p>So it is with the soul! It is often apparently the
sport and captive of opposing currents. It has its
pools of darkness, its eddies of unbelief, its jagged
rocks of despair, but it will eventually clear them all.
"All motion," to use the words of one of the best
and saintliest of the old writers on this very Psalm
(Sibbs), and which carry out our illustration, "All
motion tends to rest, and ends in it. God is the
centre and resting-place of the soul; and here David
takes up his rest, and so let us. We see that discussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of objections in the consistory of the Soul,
settles the Soul at last&mdash;Faith at length silencing
all risings to the contrary. Then whatsoever times
come, we are sure of a hiding-place and a sanctuary."</p>

<p>Yes! your life, notwithstanding all these fluctuations,
will end triumphantly. It may, as in
this Psalm, be now a pÃ¦an, then a dirge; now a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere</i>, then a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te
Deum</i> may be interweaved throughout; but the latter
will close the Life-story&mdash;the concluding strain
will be the anthem of Victory. You may arrest the
arrow in its flight&mdash;you may chain the waterfall, or
stay the lightning, sooner than unsay the words of
God, "<em>He that hath begun a good work in you
will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ</em>."
(Phil. i. 6.)</p>

<p>Remember, God does not say, that "good work"
is never to be impeded. He has never given promise
in Scripture of an unclouded day&mdash;uninterrupted
sunshine&mdash;a waveless, stormless sea. No, "the morning
without clouds" is a heavenly emblem. The
earthly one is "a day, in which the light shall neither
be clear nor dark." (Zech. xiv. 6.) The analogy of
the outer world of nature, at least under these our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
chequered and ever-varying skies, teaches us this.
Spring comes smiling, and pours her blossoms into
the lap of Summer. But the skies lower, and the
rain and battering hail descend, and the virgin
blossoms droop their heads and almost die. Summer
again smiles and the meadows look gay; the
flowers ring merry chimes with their leaves and
petals, and Autumn with glowing face is opening her
bosom for the expected treasure. But all at once
drought comes with her fiery footsteps. Every
blade and floweret, gasping for breath, lift their
blanched eyelids to the brazen sky; or the night-winds
rock the laden branches and strew the ground. Thus
we see it is not one unvarying, unchecked progression,
from the opening bud to the matured fruit.
But every succeeding month is scarred and mutilated
by drought and moisture, wind and rain, storm
and sunshine. Yet, never once has Autumn failed
to gather up her golden sheaves; ay, and if you
ask her testimony, she will tell that the very storm,
and wind, and rain you dreaded as foes, were the
best auxiliaries in filling her yellow garners.</p>

<p>If the experience of any one here present be that
of "the deep" and "the water-flood"&mdash;"the stormy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
wind and tempest," think ever of the closing words of
the Psalm, and let them "turn your mourning into
dancing; take off your sackcloth, and gird you with
gladness!" <em>You</em> may change towards God, but He
is unchanging towards <em>you</em>. The stars may be
swept from our view by intervening clouds, but
they shine bright as ever,&mdash;undimmed altar-fires in
the great temple of the universe. Our <em>vision</em> may
be at fault, but not their radiance and undying
glory. The Being "not confined to temples made
with hands," who met this wrestler of old in the
forest of Gilead, and poured better than Gilead's balm
into his bosom, is the same now as He was then.
And if thou art a wrestler too, He seems through
the moaning of the storm to say, "<em>Though thou
fall, yet shalt thou not be cast down utterly, for the
Lord upholdeth thee with his right hand</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>My God!</em>" Oh, if that be the last entry in the
Diary of religious experience, be not desponding
now because of present passing shadows, but "thank
God and take courage." It is written that "at evening-time
it shall be light." (Zech. xiv. 7.) The sun
may wade all day through murky clouds, but he
will pillow his head at night on a setting couch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
vermilion and gold. "Though ye have lien among
the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove
covered with silver, and her feathers with <em>yellow
gold</em>."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It was said by aged Jacob, in his prophetic
death-song, regarding that very tribe on the borders
of which the royal exile now sang, "<span class="smcap">Gad</span>, <em>a troop
shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the
last</em>."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Was not this the key-note of his present
elegy? Faith could lift its head triumphant in the
clang of battle, amid these troops of spiritual plunderers,
and sing, "<em>Though an host should encamp
against me, my heart shall not fear: though war
should rise against me, in</em> <small>THIS</small> <em>will I be confident.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<h2>III.</h2>

<h3>A PECULIAR EXPERIENCE.</h3>

<p>Although this Psalm, in bold and striking figure,
presents a faithful miniature picture of the Believer's
life, we must regard it as depicting an extraordinary
experience at a peculiar passage of David's
history, and which has its counterpart still in that
of many of God's children.</p>

<p>The writer of the Psalm was evidently undergoing
"spiritual depression"&mdash;what is sometimes spoken
of as "spiritual desertion,"&mdash;that sorrow, awful in
its reality&mdash;too deep for utterance&mdash;deeper than the
yawning chasm made by family bereavement&mdash;the
sorrow of all sorrows, the loss of God in the soul!</p>

<p>There is much caution needed in speaking of this.
There are causes which lead to spiritual depression
which are purely physical, arising from a diseased
body, an overstrung mind&mdash;a succession of calamities
weakening and impairing the nervous system. We
know how susceptible are the body and mind together,
of being affected by external influences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
"We are," says an able analyser of human emotions,
"fearfully and wonderfully made. Of that constitution
which in our ignorance we call union of soul
and body, we know little respecting what is cause,
and what effect. We would fain believe that the
mind has power over the body; but it is just as true
that the body rules the mind. Causes apparently
the most trivial&mdash;a heated room, want of exercise&mdash;a
sunless day, a northern aspect&mdash;will make all the
difference between happiness and unhappiness; between
faith and doubt; between courage and indecision.
To our fancy there is something humiliating
in being thus at the mercy of our animal organism.
We would fain find nobler causes for our emotions."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Yes&mdash;many of those sighs and tears, and
morbid, depressed feelings, which Christians speak
of as the result of spiritual darkness and the desertion
of God, are merely the result of physical derangement,
the penalty often for the violation of
the laws of health. The atmosphere we breathe is
enough to account for them. They come and go&mdash;rise
and fall with the mercury in the tube. These
are cases, not for the spiritual, but for the bodily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
physician. Their cure is in attendance to the usual
laws and prescriptions which regulate the healthy
action of the bodily functions.</p>

<p>There is another class of causes which lead to
spiritual depression which are partly physical and
partly religious. There must necessarily be depression
where there is undue elation; where the soul-structure
is built on fluctuating frames and feelings,
and the religious life is made more <em>subjective</em> than
<em>objective</em>.</p>

<p>Many imagine, unless they are at all times in a glow
of fervour&mdash;an ecstatic frame of feeling&mdash;all must be
wrong with them.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Now, there is nothing more dangerous
or deceptive than a life of mere feeling; and
its <em>most</em> dangerous phase is a life of religious emotional
excitement. It is in the last degree erroneous
to consider all this glowing ecstasy of frame a necessary
condition of healthy spiritual life. Artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
excitement, in any shape, is perilous. Apart altogether
from the moral and religious aspect of the
question, the tendency of the ball-room and theatre,
and a preference in reading for works of fiction,
is to make a man nauseate the plain, commonplace
work, the occurrences and themes of this every-day
world. Feed him on dainties and forced meats, and
he despises husks and plain fare. Equally true is
this with regard to the life of the soul. It is not
fed on luscious stimulants and ecstatic experiences.
When it is so, the result is every now and then
a collapse; like a child building his mimic castle
too high, the perpendicular and equilibrium are
lost. It totters and falls, and he has just to begin
again. The dew distils, and hangs its spangled
jewels on blade and flower, gently and in silence.
The rain comes down in tiny particles and soft
showers, not in drenching water-floods. So the
healthy Christian holds on the even tenor of his
way, unaffected by the barometer of feeling. He
knows this is apt to be elevated and depressed by
a thousand accidents over which he has no control.
His life is fed, not from the fitful and uncertain
streams issuing from the low ground of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
experience, but from the snow-clad summits&mdash;the
Alps of God. Were he thus suffering himself to
depend on the rills of his own feelings, his brook
would often be dry in summer&mdash;the season when
he most needed it; whereas the supply from the
glacier-beds on which the sun shines, is fullest in
these very times of drought.</p>

<p>Add to this, religion is shorn of its glory when it
is dwarfed into a mere thing of sentiment and feeling.
Its true grandeur and greatness is, when it
incorporates itself with active duty, and fulfils its
best definition as not a "<em>being</em>" but a "<em>doing</em>."
Of nothing, therefore, do we require to be more
jealous, than a guilty, unmanly, morbid dwelling on
feelings and experiences. You remember Elijah,
when he fled pusillanimous and panic-stricken
from his work, and took to a hermit-cell amid the
solitudes of Sinai. We find him seated in his
lonely cave, his head drooping on his breast, sullen
thought mantling his brow, muttering his querulous
soliloquy, "I am left alone." The voice of God
hunts out the fugitive from duty. "What doest
thou here, Elijah? Why in this cave, brooding in
a coward spirit, unworthy of thee? Art thou to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
cease to work for <em>Me</em>, because the high day of
excitements on the heights of Carmel are over?
Here is food to strengthen thy body, and here is
'the still, small voice' of my love to strengthen
thy soul. Go forth to active duty. Leave thy cave
and thy cloak behind thee. Take thy pilgrim-staff
and scrip, and with the consciousness of a
great work in hand, and a brief time to do it in,
arise, and onward to Horeb, the mount of God!"
(1 Kings xix.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But having thrown out these preliminary cautions,
the question occurs: <em>Are</em> there no cases of spiritual
depression or desertion, arising purely from
<em>spiritual</em> causes?</p>

<p>We answer, Yes. The Bible recognises such
Spiritual darkness&mdash;absence of all spiritual comfort
and joy&mdash;is no figment of man's theological creed.
It is a sad and solemn verity&mdash;the experience, too,
of God's own children. "Who is among you that
feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his
servant, <em>that walketh in darkness, and hath no
light</em>?" (Isa. l. 10.) "Oh," says the afflicted
patriarch of Uz, "that I were as in months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
past, as in the days when God preserved me;
when his candle shined upon my head, and when
by his light I walked through darkness." (Job
xxix. 2, 3.) "In my prosperity," is the testimony of
David, at a later period of his life, "I said, I shall
never be moved. Lord, by thy favour thou hast
made my mountain to stand strong: <em>thou didst
hide thy face, and I was troubled</em>." (Ps. xxx. 5-7.)
"I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets,
and in the broad ways I will seek him whom
my soul loveth: <em>I sought him, but I found him
not</em>.... My beloved had <em>withdrawn himself, and
was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought
him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he
gave me no answer</em>." (Sol. Song iii. 2, v. 6.) Can
we forget a more awful and impressive example?
<span class="smcap">One</span> soaring above the reach of all grovelling human
experiences, but yet who tells us, in His bitter Eloi
cry, that even <span class="smcap">He</span> knew what it was to be God-deserted
and forsaken!</p>

<p>Are there any whose eyes trace these pages who
have ever undergone such a season? or it may be are
undergoing it now? I stop not to inquire as to the
cause;&mdash;indulged sin, omitted or carelessly performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
duty, neglect of prayer, worldly conformity.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Are
you feelingly alive, painfully conscious that your
love, like that of many, has waxed cold;&mdash;are you
mourning that you have not the nearness to the
Mercy-seat that once you enjoyed,&mdash;not the love of
your Bibles, and ordinances, and sacraments that
you once had,&mdash;that a heavy cloud mantles your
spiritual horizon,&mdash;God's countenance, not what
once it was, irradiated with a Father's smiles,&mdash;nor
heaven what once it seemed, a second home?</p>

<p>"O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, not comforted!"
do not despond. In these very sighings
and moanings of your downcast spirit, there are elements
for hope and comfort, not for despair. They
are the evidences and indications that the spark,
though feeble, is not quenched&mdash;that the pulse,
though languid, still beats&mdash;that faith, though like a
grain of mustard-seed, is still germinating. "O thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of little faith, wherefore dost thou doubt?" It is
that very <em>shadow</em> that has now come athwart your
soul, and which you so bitterly mourn, which tells of
<em>sunshine</em>. As it is the shadow which enables us to
read the hours on the dial, so is it in the spiritual life.
It is because of these shadows on the soul's dial-face
that we can infer the shining of a better Sun. "The
wicked have no bands in <em>their</em> (spiritual) death."
Their life has been nothing but shadow; they cannot
therefore mourn the loss of a sunshine they
never felt or enjoyed. Well has it been said,
"When the refreshing dews of grace seem to be
withheld, and we are ready to say, 'Our hope is lost,
God hath forgotten to be gracious'&mdash;this is that furnace
in which one that is not a child of God never
was placed. For Satan takes good care not to disquiet
his children. He has no fire for their souls
on this side everlasting burnings; his fatal teaching
ever is, Peace, peace!"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But what, desponding one,
is, or ought to be, thy resort? Go! exile in spirit&mdash;go,
like that royal mourner amid the oak-thickets
of Gilead! Brood no more in unavailing sorrow
and with burning tears. Thou mayest, like him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
have much to depress thy spirit. Black and crimson
sins may have left their indelible stain on the
page of memory. In aching heart-throbs, thou
mayest be heaving forth the bitter confession, "<em>Mine</em>
iniquities have separated between me and my God."
But go like him! take down thy silent harp. Its
strings may be corroded with rust. They may tell
the touching story of a sad estrangement. Go to
the quiet solitude of thy chamber. Seek out the
unfrequented path of prayer;&mdash;choked it may be
with the weeds of forgetfulness and sloth. Cast
thyself on thy bended knees; and, as the wounded
deer bounds past thee (emblem of thine own bleeding
heart), wake the echoes of thy spirit with the
penitential cry, "<em>As the hart panteth after the
water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O
God!</em>"</p>

<h2>I.</h2>

<h3>THE HART PANTING.</h3>

<p>We have pictured, in a preceding chapter, the
uncrowned Monarch of Israel seated, pensive and
sad, amid "the willows by the water-courses;" or
wandering forth, amid the deepening twilight-shadows,
with the roll of Jordan at his side, perhaps,
like his great ancestor, to "wrestle with God
until the breaking of the day."</p>

<p>We have already adverted to the simple incident
which arrested his attention. A breathless tenant
of the forest bounded past him to quench its thirst
in the neighbouring river. That unconscious child
of nature furnishes the key-note of his song. Let
us sit by the banks, as the Exile takes down his
harp, and thus sings&mdash;"<span class="smcap">As the hart panteth
after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul
after thee, O God</span>."</p>

<p>God is the only satisfying portion of the soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Every theory of human happiness is defective and
incomplete which falls short of the aspirations of
our immortal natures. Born with capacities for the
infinite, man naturally spurns the finite. No satellite,
with its borrowed light, will compensate for the
loss of the sun. You may as well expect the caged
wild beast to be happier within the iron bars of his
den than roaming lord of the forest, as for the
human spirit to be content with the present and
the finite as a substitute for the immortal and
the infinite! The water-brooks alone could slake
the thirst of that roe on the mountains of Gilead.
You might have offered it choicest pastures. You
might have bid it roam the sunniest glades of
the forest, or repose under the majestic shadow of
the monarch-oaks of Bashan; it would have spurned
them all; and, with fleet foot, have bounded down
the valley in search of the stream.</p>

<p>So with the soul. Nothing but the stream flowing
from the Everlasting Hills will satisfy it. You
may tempt a man, as he is hurrying on his immortal
way, with the world's pastures,&mdash;you may hold out to
him the golden sheaves of riches,&mdash;you may detain
him amid the sunny glades of pleasure, or on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
hill-tops of fame (and he is but too willing for a while
to linger)&mdash;but satisfy him they cannot! When his
nobler nature acquires its rightful ascendancy he
will spurn them all. Brushing each one in succession
away, as the stag does the dewy drops of the
morning, he will say&mdash;"All are insufficient! I wish
them not. I have been mocked by their failure.
I have found that each has a lie in its right hand;&mdash;it
is a poor counterfeit&mdash;a shadowy figure of the true.
I want the fountain of living waters&mdash;I want the
Infinite of Knowledge, Goodness, Truth, Love!"
"In the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> put I my trust: why say ye to my
soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The fact is, it is the very grandeur of the soul
which leads it thus to pant after God. Small things
satisfy a small capacity, but what is made receptive
of the vast and glorious can only be satisfied with
great things. The mind of the child is satisfied with
the toy or the bauble; the mind of the untutored
savage with bits of painted glass or tinsel; but the
man, the sage, the philosopher, desiderate higher
possessions, purer knowledge, nobler themes of
thought and objects of ambition. Some insects are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
born for an hour, and are satisfied with it. A summer's
afternoon is the duration of existence allotted
to myriads of tiny <em>ephemera</em>. In <em>their</em> case, youth
and age are crowded into a few passing minutes.
The descending sun witnesses their birth and death;&mdash;the
lifetime of other animals would be to them an
immortality. The soul, being infinite and unlimited
in its capacities, has correspondingly high aspirations.
Vain would be the attempt to fill up a yawning gulf
by throwing into it a few grains of sand. But not
more vain or ineffectual than try to answer the deep
yearnings of the human spirit by the seen and the
temporal.</p>

<p>Yes! on all the world's fountains, drink at them as
you may, "<em>thirst again</em>" is written. Of the world's
mountains, climb them as you may, you will never
say, "I have reached the coveted summit. It is
enough." Men go sighing on, drinking their rivers
of pleasure and climbing their mountains of vanity.
They feel all the while some undefined, inarticulate,
nameless longing after a satisfying good; but it is
a miserable travestie to say that it has been found,
or can be found, in anything here. "<em>Who will shew
us any good?</em>" will still be the cry of the groping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
seeker till he has learned to say, "<em>Lord, lift</em> <span class="smcap">Thou</span>
<em>upon me the light of thy countenance.</em>"</p>

<p>We know how hard and difficult it is to convince
of these sublime verities. The soul, even in its
hours of trouble and deep conviction, is like a castaway
from shipwreck, who sees from his raft-planks
something cresting the waves. He imagines it an
island! As he nears it, he fancies he sees purple
flowers drooping over the solid rock, and the sea-birds
nestling in the crevices. But it is only an
aggregate of withered leaves and rotten branches,
which the receding tide has tossed together, the
wayward freak of old ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>Let him who would solve this great problem of
Happiness go to that parable of nature&mdash;the hunted
Stag seeking the water-brooks, the thirsty soul seeking
its God. God is the <em>home</em> of the soul, and
he is away from home who pitches his tent and
weaves his heart-affections around anything short
of Him. Who has not heard of "home-sickness"&mdash;the
desolate feelings of the lonely stranger
in a strange land? Let affection, and friendship,
and pity do what they may to alleviate the pang of
distance and separation, though beaming faces be
around, and hands of love and sympathy be extended,
still will the heart (despite of all) be roaming the old
hallowed haunts, climbing in thought the hills of
childhood, gazing on the old village church with its
festoons of ivy, seated under the aged elm, or listening
to the music of the passing brook and the music
of voices sweeter and lovelier than all! The soul
is that stranger, dwelling in the tents of Kedar,
and panting for Heaven and God. Its language
is, "I am <em>not</em> at home, I am a stranger here."
Manifold, too, are the voices in this the land of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
exile, whispering, "<em>Arise ye and depart, for this is</em>
<small>NOT</small> <em>your rest!</em>"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>You may have seen in our mountain glens, in the
solemn twilight, birds winging their way to their
nests. There may be lovely bowers, gardens of
fragrance and beauty, close by,&mdash;groves inviting to
sweetest melody, Nature's consecrated haunts of song.
But they tempt them not. Their nests&mdash;their <em>homes</em>&mdash;are
in yonder distant rock, and thither they speed
their way! So with the soul. The painted glories
of this world will not satisfy it. There is no rest in
these for its weary wing and wailing cry. It goes
singing up and home to God. It has its nest in the
crevices of the Rock of Ages. When detained in
the nether valley, often is the warbling note heard,
"Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I
flee away, and be at rest." And when the flight has
been made from the finite to the infinite&mdash;from the
lower valleys of sense to the hills of faith&mdash;from the
creature to the Creator&mdash;from man to God,&mdash;as we
see it folding its buoyant pinion and sinking into
the eternal clefts, we listen to the song, "<em>Return
unto thy rest, O my soul</em>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Reader! may this flight be yours. "Seek ye the
Lord while He may be found!" The creature may
change, He cannot. The creature must die, He is
eternal. "<em>O God, thou art my God; early will I
seek</em> <span class="smcap">Thee</span>: <em>my soul thirsteth for</em> <span class="smcap">Thee</span>, <em>my flesh
longeth for</em> <span class="smcap">Thee</span> <em>in a dry and thirsty land, where no
water is.... Because Thy loving-kindness is better
than life, my lips shall praise Thee.</em>" (Ps. lxiii.)</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<h3>The Hart Wounded.</h3>

<p>Are we not warranted to infer that it was the
<em>wounded</em> stag which David now saw, or pictured he
saw, seeking the brooks?&mdash;the hart hit by the archers,
with blood-drops standing on its flanks, and its eye
glazed with faintness, exhaustion, and death? But
for these wounds it would never have come to the
Valley. It would have been nestling still up in its
native heath&mdash;the thick furze and cover of the mountain
heights of Gilead. But the shaft of the archer
had sped with unerring aim; and, with distended
nostril and quivering limb, it hastens to allay the
rage of its death-thirst.</p>

<p>Picture of David, ay, and of many who have
been driven to drink of that "river, the streams
whereof make glad the city of God." They are
<em>wounded</em> spirits; the arrow festering in their souls,
and drawing their life-blood. Faint, trembling, forlorn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
weary, they have left the world's high ground&mdash;the
heights of vanity, and indifference, and self-righteousness,
and sin&mdash;and have sought the lowly
Valley of humiliation.</p>

<p>What are some of these arrows? There are
arrows from the quiver of <small>MAN</small>, and arrows from the
quiver of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>The <em>arrows of man</em> are often the cruellest of all.
"<em>Lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready
their arrow upon the string, that they may privily
shoot at the upright in heart.</em>" (Ps. xi. 2.) <span class="smcap">Envy</span>
is an archer. His shaft is dipped in gall and wormwood.
<span class="smcap">Jealousy</span> is a bowman, whose barbed weapons
cannot stand the prosperity of a rival. <span class="smcap">Revenge</span>
has his quiver filled with keen points of
steel, that burn to retaliate the real or imagined injury.
<span class="smcap">Malice</span> is an archer that seeks his prey in
ambush. He lurks behind the rock. He inflicts his
wanton mischief&mdash;irreparable injury&mdash;on the absent
or innocent. <span class="smcap">Contempt</span> is a bowman of soaring
aim. He looks down with haughty, supercilious
scorn on others. The teeth of such "are spears and
arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword." (Ps. lvii.
4.) <span class="smcap">Deceit.</span>&mdash;He is, in these our days, a huntsman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of repute&mdash;a modern Nimrod&mdash;with gilded arrows
in his quiver, and a bugle, boasting great things,
slung at his girdle. He makes his target the unsuspecting;
decoys them, with siren look, within his
toils, and leaves them, wounded and helpless, on "the
mountains of prey!" "<em>Deliver my soul, O Lord,
from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. What
shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto
thee, thou false tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty,
with coals of juniper.</em>" (Ps. cxx. 2-4.)</p>

<p>But there are arrows also from the <em>quiver of</em>
<span class="smcap">God</span>. "<em>The arrows of the Almighty</em>," says Job,
"<em>are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my
spirit.</em>" (Job vi. 4.) "<em>He hath bent His bow,</em>" says
Jeremiah, "<em>and set me as a mark for the arrow.
He hath causÃ©d the arrows of His quiver to enter
into my reins.</em>" (Lam. iii. 12, 13.) And who will not
breathe the prayer of the Gilead Exile at another
time?&mdash;"<em>Let me fall into the hands of God, for
great are</em> <span class="smcap">His</span> <em>mercies!</em>" "<em>Faithful are the wounds
of</em> <span class="smcap">this</span> <em>friend.</em>" (2 Sam. xxiv. 14; Prov. xxvii. 6.)</p>

<p>We need not stop to enumerate particularly these
<em>arrows</em>. There is the blanched arrow of <em>sickness</em>,
the rusted arrow of <em>poverty</em>, the lacerating arrow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<em>bereavement</em>, stained and saturated with tears, and
feathered from our own bosoms! There is the
arrow, too, (though of a different kind,) of God's
own blessed <em>Word</em>, "quick and powerful." "<em>Thine
arrows are sharp in the heart of the King's
enemies.</em>" (Ps. xlv. 5.)</p>

<p>Yet, blessed be God, these are often arrows which
wound only to heal; or rather, which, from the
wounds they create, send the bleeding, panting,
thirsting soul to seek the waters of comfort in God
himself. Suffering one! be thankful for thy wounds.
But for these shafts thou mightest have been, at this
moment, sleeping on the mountain heights of self-righteousness,
or worldliness, or sin, with no thought
of thy soul; the streams of salvation disowned; forsaking,
and continuing to forsake, the "Fountain of
Living Waters."</p>

<p>Let me ask, Has this been the result of thy
woundings? Have they led thee from the "broken
(leaky) cistern" to say, "All my springs are in
<small>Thee</small>?" Remember affliction, worldly calamity,
bereavement, have a twofold effect. It is a solemn
alternative! They may drive thee nearer, they may
drive thee farther from, thy God. They may drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
thee down to the gushing stream, or farther up the
cold, freezing mountain-side. The wounded hart of
this Psalm, on receiving the sting of the arrow,
might have plunged only deeper and deeper into the
toils of the huntsmen, or the solitudes of the forest.
It might have gone with its pining eye, and broken
heart, and bleeding wound, to bury itself amid the
withered leaves.</p>

<p>How many there are whose afflictions seem to
lead to this sad consequence; who, when mercies
and blessings are removed, abandon themselves to
sullen and morbid fretfulness; who, instead of
bowing submissive to the hand that wounds and is
able to heal, seem to feel as if they were denuded of
their rights! Their language is the bitter reproach
of Jonah&mdash;"<em>I do well to be angry, even unto death</em>."
Muffling themselves in hardened unbelief, their
wretched solace is that of despair&mdash;"<i>It is better for
me to die than to live</i>."</p>

<p>"<em>Blessed is the man that</em> <small>ENDURETH</small> <em>temptation</em>,"
not who rushes away to pine, and bleed, and die;&mdash;or
to feed still on husks and the garbage of the wilderness,
but who makes the nobler resolve, "<em>I will arise
and go to my Father</em>." Blessed is the man whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
cry, like that of the child, is answered by his
heavenly Parent bending over the cradle of his sorrow;&mdash;who
feels, as the Psalmist did, that his gracious
Father and God is never so near him as in a
time of trial. "<em>When my spirit was overwhelmed,</em>
THEN <span class="smcap">Thou</span> <em>knewest my path.</em>" The bird of
the desert is said to bury its head in the sand
on the approach of its foes, and to abandon itself
to destruction; but blessed is the man who
rather is like the bird of the grove, the first twigs of
whose nest have been ruthlessly pulled to pieces by
the hand of violence. Hovering for a while over
her pillaged home, she fills the wood with her plaintive
lament, then soars away from the haunt of the
destroyer to begin a fresh one, in a place of safety,
on the top branch of some cedar of God!</p>

<p>Such was the case with David on the occasion of
this Psalm. He had read to him the most touching
homily the world <em>could</em> read on the precarious
tenure of earthly blessings. His sceptre, his crown,
his family, were like the bubbles on that foaming
stream on which he gazed, dancing their little
moment on its surface, then gone, and gone for ever.
Is he to abandon himself to an ignoble despair? Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
he to conclude that the Lord has made him a target
on which to exhaust His quiver&mdash;that He has "forgotten
to be gracious?" Is he to join marauding
chiefs beyond the Jordan, savage freebooters&mdash;become
a mountain adventurer on these Gentile borders, and
forget Zion and Zion's God? No! the earthly crown
may fade, but the homeless, uncrowned, unsceptred
monarch has a better home and a better King above;
invisible walls and battlements, better than all
the trenches and moats of an earthly fortress, encompass
the wanderer. With his eye on these,
thus he weaves his warrior song&mdash;"<em>I will say of
the Lord, He is my rock, and my fortress, and my
deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will
trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation,
and my high tower</em>." (Ps. xviii. 2.)</p>

<p>Reader! let me ask you, in closing this chapter,
are <em>you</em> panting for God?</p>

<p>This is not the way&mdash;this is not the history of
<em>most</em>. They are panting, but <em>not</em> for God! They
are panting up the hill, like Sisyphus, with their
huge stone. <em>Ambition</em> is panting up the hill&mdash;no
time to take a breath. <em>Pleasure</em> is panting up
the hill&mdash;pursuing her butterfly existence&mdash;a phantom-chase&mdash;rushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from flower to flower, extracting
all the luscious sweets she can. <em>Fame</em> is
panting up the hill, blowing her trumpet before
her, eager to erect her own monument on the
coveted apex. <em>Mammon</em> is pushing up the hill
with his panting team, to erect the temple of riches.
Multitudes of hapless wayfarers in the same reckless
scramble have tumbled into crevices, and are crying
for help. Mammon's wheels are locked,&mdash;his treasure-chests
have fallen into the mire;&mdash;and yet, <em>on</em>
he goes, driving his jaded steeds over the poor, and
weak, and helpless&mdash;ay, those that assisted him
to load before he started at the mountain base. He
must gain the top at all hazards as best he may;
and he will be crowned a hero, too, and lauded for
his feat!</p>

<p>Ah! strange that men should still be pursuing
that phantom-chase. Or, rather, strange that they
should live so immeasurably beneath the grandeur
of their own destiny; rasping the shallows when
they should be out in the deep sea; furling and
warping the sails of immortality, instead of having
every available yard of canvas spread to the breeze
of heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>These objects of earthly, perishable pursuit, <em>may</em>
do when the world is bright, the heart unwounded,
the eye undimmed. These may do when the sun
shines unclouded in our firmament, when our fields
are waving, when fortune is weaving her golden
web, and the bark of existence with its white sails
is holding its way through summer seas. These
may do when the home circle is unbroken; when we
miss no loved face, when we mark no silent voice,
no vacant chair. <em>But</em> when the muffled drum takes
the place of life's joyous music;&mdash;when our skies are
robed in sackcloth, when Nature takes on its hue
of ashen paleness; when every flower, seared and
frost-bitten, seems to droop its head in sadness and
sorrow, and hide its tears amid withered leaves and
blighted stems, exuding only the fragrance of decay!&mdash;what
<em>then</em>? The prophet's voice takes up the lesson&mdash;"<em>The
voice said, Cry; and he said, What shall I
cry? All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man
as the flower of the grass!</em>" Poor trifler that thou
art! to be so long mocked and deceived by a dead
and dying world; desolate, friendless, hopeless, portionless;
a vessel driven from its moorings, out unpiloted
on a tempestuous sea! <span class="smcap">But</span> there is a haven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
for the tempest-tossed. The Saviour thou hast long
despised and rejected, is a provided harbour for
such as <em>thee</em>. "<em>A</em> <small>MAN</small> <em>shall be an hiding-place from
the wind, a covert from the tempest, as rivers of
water in a dry place, the shadow of a great rock
in a weary land.</em>" (Isaiah xxxii. 2.)</p>

<p>Art thou panting after the streams of salvation?
The Shepherd who feeds His flock by these "still
waters" thus addresses thee&mdash;<span class="smcap">Let him that is
athirst, come</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Athirst!</span> who is not athirst? It is the attribute
of universal humanity! Who does not feel that
this world is presenting us with muddy streams and
broken, leaky cisterns? Who does not feel, in their
moments of deep and calm reflection, when we are
brought face to face with the great enigma of existence,
that the world is serving up faded flowers
instead of those redolent with imperishable fragrance,
and glowing with unfading bloom? <em>Friendless
one!</em>&mdash;thou who art standing alone like a solitary
tree in the forest whom the woodman's axe has
spared&mdash;thy compeers cut down at thy side&mdash;<span class="smcap">Come!</span>
<em>Child of calamity!</em>&mdash;the chill hand of
penury laid on thine earthly comforts&mdash;the widow's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
cruise fast failing, her staff of bread diminishing&mdash;<span class="smcap">Come</span>!
<em>Child of bereavement!</em>&mdash;the pillars in thy
heart-shrine crumbling to decay, thy head bowed
like a bulrush&mdash;thou who knowest that fortune
may again replace and replenish her dismantled
walls, but that nothing can reanimate thy still
marble, or refill the vacant niche in thy heart of
hearts&mdash;<span class="smcap">Come!</span> <em>Prodigal!</em>&mdash;wanderer from God,
exile from peace, roaming the forest-haunts of sin,
plunging deeper and deeper into their midnight of
ruin and despair&mdash;has an arrow, either from the
quiver of man, or of God, wounded thy heart? Art
thou, in thy agony, seeking rest and finding none,&mdash;having
the gnawing feeling of dissatisfaction with
all created things, and an undefined longing for a
solace they cannot give? Yes! for <em>thee</em>, too, for
thy gaping, bleeding wound there is "balm in
Gilead, and a Physician there." I repeat, Jesus
this day stands by the glorious streams of His own
purchased salvation, and cries, saying&mdash;"<em>If any
man</em> <small>THIRST</small>, <em>let him come unto me and drink</em>!"</p>

<p>"Yea, Lord!" be it yours to reply&mdash;"Lord, I
<em>come!</em> thirsty, faint, forlorn, wounded, weary! I
come, 'just as I am, without one plea.' Thou art all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
I need, all I require, in sickness and health, in joy
and in sorrow, in life and in death, in time and
through eternity. The snow-clad hills may cease to
feed the brooks;&mdash;that sun may cease to shine, or
nature grow weary of his loving beams;&mdash;that
moon may cease on her silver lyre, night by night,
to discourse to the listening earth;&mdash;the birds
may become mute at the voice of the morning;&mdash;flowers
may droop, instead of ringing their thousand
bells at the jubilant step of summer;&mdash;the gasping
pilgrim may rush from the stream, and prefer the
fiery furnace-glow of the desert sands,&mdash;but 'this
God shall be my God for ever and ever;' and,
even when death is sealing my eyes, and the rush
of darkness is coming over my spirit, even then will
I take up the old exile strain&mdash;the great sigh of
weary humanity&mdash;and blend its notes with the song
of heaven&mdash;'<span class="smcap">As the hart panteth after the
water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee,
O God</span>.'"</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<h3>THE LIVING GOD.</h3>

<p>In the two former chapters, we listened to the first
sigh of the exile&mdash;the first strain of his plaintive
song. It was the groping and yearning of his soul
after God, as the alone object of happiness.</p>

<p>You may have watched the efforts of the plant,
tossed amid rack and weed in some dark cellar, to
climb to the light. Like the captive in the dungeon
longing to cool his fevered brow in the air of heaven,
its sickly leaves seem to struggle and gasp for
breath. They grope, with their blanched colours,
towards any chink or crevice or grated window,
through which a broken beam is admitted. Or
garden flowers choked amid rank luxuriance, or
under the shade of tree or wall, how ambitious to
assert their freedom, and pay homage to the parent
sun, lifting their pendant leaves or petals as a
target for his golden arrows!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The soul, away from the great Sun of its being,
frets and pines and mourns! Every affection
droops in languor and sadness when that light is
away. Its abortive efforts to obtain happiness in
other and meaner joys, and its dissatisfaction with
them, is itself a testimony to the strength and
loftiness of its aspiration&mdash;a manifesto of its real
grandeur! The human affections must be fastened
on <em>something</em>! They are like the clinging ivy
which creeps along the ground, and grasps stones,
rocks, weeds, and unsightly ruins, if it can find nothing
else on which to fix its tendrils; but when it
reaches the root of the tree, or base of the castle
wall, it spurns its grovelling existence, and climbs its
upward way till it hangs in graceful festoons from
the topmost branch or turret.</p>

<p>We are to contemplate, now, a second breathing
of this exiled supplicant&mdash;a new element in his
God-ward aspiration.</p>

<p>"<em>My soul thirsteth for God,</em> <span class="smcap">for the living
God</span>: <em>when shall I come and appear before God?</em>"</p>

<p>This is no mere repetition of the former verse. It
invests the believer's relationship to the object of his
faith and hope with a new and more solemn interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>For David's present condition and experience in
the land of his exile&mdash;the feeling of utter isolation
throbbing through the pulses of his soul,&mdash;there were
required some extraordinary and peculiar sources of
comfort. The old conventional dogmas of theology,
at such seasons, are insufficient. Who has not felt,
in some great crisis of their spiritual being, similar
to his, when all the hopes and joys of existence rock
and tremble to their foundations; when, by some
sudden reverse of fortune, the pride of life becomes
a shattered ruin; or, by some appalling bereavement,
the hope and solace of the future is blighted
and withered like grass;&mdash;who has not been conscious
of a longing desire to know more of this
infinite God, who holds the balances of Life and
Death in His hands, and who has come forth from
the inscrutable recesses of His own mysterious being,
and touched us to the quick? What of His character,
His attributes, His ways! There is a feeling, such
as we never had before, to draw aside the veil which
screens the Invisible. It may be faith in its feeblest
form, awaking as from a dream; lisping the very
alphabet of Divine truth, and asking, in broken and
stammering accents, "Does God <em>really live?</em>&mdash;Is it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
after all, Deity, or is it Chance, that is ruling the
world? Is this great Being near, or is He distant?
Does He take cognizance of all events in this world;
or are minute, trivial occurrences, contingent on the
accidents of nature or the caprice of man? <em>Is
He</em> <span class="smcap">the living One</span>?" God, a distant abstraction
shrouded in the awful mystery of His own attributes,
will not do;&mdash;we must realise His presence; our cry,
at such a time, is that of the old patriarch at the
brook Jabbok, or of his descendant at the brooks of
Gilead&mdash;"<em>Tell me thy</em> <small>NAME</small>."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Is it merely <em>love</em>,
or is it the loving <span class="smcap">One</span>? Is it <em>omnipotence</em>, or
is it the almighty <span class="smcap">One</span>? Is it some mysterious,
impalpable principle, some property of matter or
attribute of mind&mdash;or is it a <em>personal</em> Jehovah, one
capable of loving and of being loved? Have the
lips of incarnate truth and wisdom deceived us by a
mere figure of speech, when, in the great Liturgy of
the Church universal, in the prayer which is emphatically
"His own," He hath taught us, in its
opening words, to say, "Our <span class="smcap">Father</span> which art in
heaven, hallowed be thy <small>NAME</small>!"</p>

<p>How earnestly do the saints in former times, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
especially in their seasons of trial, cleave to the
thought of this <i>personal</i> presence; in other words,
a thirst for "the <em>living God</em>!"</p>

<p>What was the solace of the patriarch Job, as
he was stretched on his bed of sackcloth and
ashes, when other friends had turned against him
in bitter derision, and were loading him with
their reproaches? It was the realisation of a <em>living
defender</em> who would vindicate his integrity,&mdash;"<em>I
know that my Redeemer liveth</em>." (Job xix. 25.)</p>

<p>God appeared to Moses in a burning bush. The
symbol taught him encouraging truths;&mdash;that the
Hebrew race, after all their experience of fiery trial,
would come forth unscathed and unconsumed.
But the shepherd-leader desired more than this:
he craved the assurance of a <small>LIVING GOD</small>&mdash;an
ever-present guardian, a pillar to guide by day,
and a column of defence by night. It was the truth
that was borne to his ear from the desert's fiery
oracle. There could be no grander watchword for
himself, or for the enslaved people,&mdash;"<em>God said
unto Moses,</em> <span class="smcap">I am that I am!</span>" No comment is
subjoined;&mdash;nothing to diminish the glory of that
majestic utterance. The Almighty Speaker does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
not qualify it by adding, "I am light, power,
wisdom, glory;" but He simply declares His <em>being
and existence</em>&mdash;He unfolds Himself as "<em>the living
God</em>!" It is enough!</p>

<p>Elijah is in his cave at Horeb. All nature is
convulsed around him. The rocks are rent with
an earthquake. The sky is lurid with lightnings.
Fragments of these awful precipices are torn and
dislocated by the fury of the tempest, and go thundering
down the Valley. Nature testifies to the
presence, and majesty, and power of her God: but
He is not in any of these! "The Lord is not there!"
The Prophet waits for a further disclosure. He is
not satisfied with seeing the skirts of God's garment.
He must see the hand, and hear (though it
be in gentle whispers) the voice of Him who sits
behind the elements He has awoke from their sleep.
Hence this formed the closing scene in that wild
drama of the desert. "<em>After the fire there came a
still small voice.</em>" <em>The Lord is there!</em> He is proclaiming
Himself the prophet's God! with him in
the depths of that howling wilderness, as He had
been with him on the heights of Carmel. "<em>And it
was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
<em>face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the
entering in of the cave.</em>" (1 Kings xix. 12, 13.)</p>

<p>Shall we go for illustration of the same truth to
New Testament and gospel times?</p>

<p>The disciples are tossed with storm in the Sea of
Tiberias. The voice of a <em>living</em> Saviour proclaims
His <em>name</em>. "<em>It is I</em> (lit. <span class="smcap">I am</span>); <em>be not afraid!</em>"
The assurance, in that night of gloom and tempest,
lulls their trembling spirits to rest.</p>

<p>John, in Patmos, beheld, in a vision of surpassing
brightness, his Lord arrayed in the lustres of exalted
humanity. Overpowered by the glory which
unexpectedly burst upon him, "he fell at His feet
as one dead." His misgivings are stilled; his confidence
and hope restored, by the proclamation of a
<em>living</em> Saviour-God. "<em>I am He that</em> <small>LIVETH</small>" (lit.
<span class="smcap">the Living One</span>)&mdash;and a similar comforting symbol
was given him in a subsequent vision, when he
saw that same covenant angel "ascending from the
east, having the seal of the <em>Living</em> God." (Rev. i.
18, and vii. 2.)</p>

<p>This was "the <em>living</em> Jehovah" whom David now
sought in the forest-depths of Gilead. He goes out
to that solitude to meditate and pray. But it is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
dream of earthly conquest that occupies him. Deeper
thoughts have taken possession of his soul than the
loss of a kingdom and the forfeiture of a crown!
A fiercer battle engrosses his spirit than any mortal
conflict. "Let me have God," he seems to say, "as
the strength of my heart and my portion for ever,
and I heed not other portions besides." At another
time that lover of nature would have caught inspiration
from the glories of the impressive sanctuary
around. He would have sung of the water-brooks
at his side, the trees bending in adoration, the
rocky gorges through which Jordan fretted his tortuous
way, the everlasting hills of Hermon and Lebanon,&mdash;the
silent guardians of the scene,&mdash;"the
wild beasts of the forest creeping forth" and "seeking
their meat from God." But now he has but one
thought&mdash;one longing&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Thou</span> <em>art more glorious
and excellent than the mountains of prey</em>." (Ps. lxxvi.
4.) None was more dependent on the realised consciousness
of the Divine favour than he. His Psalms
seem to utter the language of one who lived in God's
presence, and to whom the withdrawal of that endearing
intercourse and communion would be death
indeed. His expressions, in these holy breathings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of his soul to the Father of spirits, seem like those
of one loving friend to another. God, the abstraction
of the Philosopher, has no place in his creed.
He speaks of "the Lord thinking upon him,"
"putting his tears into His bottle," "guiding him
with His eye," "His right hand upholding him,"
he himself "rejoicing under the shadow of His
wings;" and as if he almost beheld some visible,
tangible form, such as Peter gazed upon when the
question was put to him on the shore of Gennesaret,
"Lovest thou me?" we hear this warm, impulsive
Peter of Old Testament times thus avowing his personal
attachment&mdash;"<em>I will love thee, O Lord my
strength;</em>" "<em>I love the Lord, because He hath heard
my voice and my supplications;</em>" "<em>The Lord</em>
<small>LIVETH</small><em>; and blessed be my rock; and let the God
of my salvation be exalted</em>."</p>

<p>Reader, do you know what it is thus to exult in
God as a <em>living God</em>? Not to think of Him as
some mysterious Essence, who, by an Almighty fiat,
impressed on matter certain general laws, and, retiring
into the solitude of His own being, left these
to work out their own processes. But is there joy
to you in the thought of God ever nigh, compassing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
your path and your lying down? Do you know of
<span class="smcap">One</span>, brighter than the brightest radiance of the
visible sun, visiting your chamber with the first
waking beam of the morning; an eye of infinite
tenderness and compassion following you throughout
the day; a hand of infinite love guiding you, shielding
you from danger, and guarding you from temptation&mdash;the
"Keeper of Israel," who "neither slumbers
nor sleeps?"</p>

<p>And if gladdening it be, at all times, to hear the
footsteps of this living God, more especially gladdening
is it, as, with the Exile-King of Israel, in the
season of trial, to think of Him and to own Him, in
the midst of mysterious dealings, as One who personally
loves you, and who chastises you <em>because</em> He
loves you. The world, in their cold vocabulary, in
the hour of adversity, speak of <em>Providence</em>, "the wil
of <em>Providence</em>," "the strokes of <em>Providence</em>." <span class="smcap">Providence!</span>
What is that? Why dethrone a living
God from the sovereignty of His own world? Why
substitute a cold, death-like abstraction in place of
a living One, an acting One, a controlling One, and
(to as many as He loves) a rebuking One and a chastening
One? Why forbid the angel of bereavement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to drop from his wings the balmy fragrance, "Thy
Father hath done it?" How it would take the sting
from many a goading trial thus to see, as Job did,
nothing but the hand of God&mdash;to see that hand behind
the gleaming swords of the Sabeans, the flash
of the lightning, and the wings of the whirlwind&mdash;and
to say like David, on the occasion of his mournful
march to these very wilds of Gilead, "<em>I was
dumb, I opened not my mouth; because</em> <span class="smcap">Thou</span>
<em>didst it</em>." (Psalm xxxix. 9.)</p>

<p>The thought of a living God forms the happiness
of Heaven. It is the joy of Angels. It forms
the essence and bliss of glorified Saints. The redeemed
multitude, while on earth, "<em>thirsted</em>" for
the living God, but they had then only some feeble
foretastes of His presence. They sipped only some
tiny rills flowing from the Everlasting Fountain;
now they have reached the living spring; and the
long-drawn sigh of the earthly valley is answered&mdash;"When
shall we come and <em>appear before God</em>?"</p>

<p>And what this living God is to the Church above,
He is also to the Church below. In one sense we
need Him more! The drooping, pining plant, battered
down by rain, and hail, and tempest, stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
more in need of the fostering hand and genial sunbeam
than the sturdy tree whose roots are firmly
moored in the soil, or sheltered from the sweep
of the storm. Pilgrims in the Valley of Tears! seek
to live more under the habitual thought of God's
presence. In dark passages of our earthly history
we know how supporting it is to enjoy the sympathy
of kindred <em>human</em> friends. What must it be to have
the consciousness of the presence, and support, and
nearness of the Being of all beings; when some
cherished "light of the dwelling" is put out, to
have a better light remaining, which sorrow cannot
quench! All know the story of the little child who,
in simple accents, quieted its own fears and that of
others in the midst of a storm. When the planks
were creaking beneath them&mdash;the hoarse voice of the
thunder above mingling with that of the raging sea;&mdash;his
tiny finger pointed to the calm visage of the
pilot, who was steering with brawny arm through
the surge, "<em>My father</em>," said he, "<em>is at the helm</em>!"
Would you weather the tempests of life, and sit
calm and unmoved amid "the noise of its many
waters," let your eye rest on a <em>living God</em>&mdash;a loving
Father&mdash;a heavenly Pilot. See Him guiding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Vessel of your temporal and eternal destinies! Let
Faith be heard raising her triumphant accents
amid the pauses of the storm&mdash;"<em>O Lord our God,
who is a strong Lord like unto Thee? Thou rulest
the raging of the sea; when the waves thereof arise,
Thou stillest them.</em>" (Psalm lxxxix. 9.)</p>

<p>Above all, be it yours to enjoy what David knew
imperfectly, the conscious nearness of a living <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>,&mdash;a
Brother on the throne of Heaven&mdash;"<em>Christ
our life</em>"&mdash;God in our nature&mdash;"the man Christ
Jesus,"&mdash;susceptible of every human sympathy&mdash;capable
of entering, with infinite tenderness, into every
human want and woe&mdash;bending over us with His
pitying eye&mdash;marking out for us our path&mdash;ordering
our sorrows&mdash;filling or emptying our cup&mdash;providing
our pastures, and "making all things work together
for our good!" The words at this moment are as
true as when, eighteen hundred years ago, they came
fresh from His lips in Patmos&mdash;"I am <em>the living</em> One!&mdash;Behold,
I am <em>alive</em> for evermore!" (Rev. i. 18.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What is the great lesson from this meditation?
Is it not to strive to <em>be like God</em>? What does
"thirsting" for God mean, but a longing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
soul after likeness and conformity to the Divine
image? Let us not lose the deep truth of the text
under the material emblem. To thirst for God
is to desire His fellowship; and we can only hold
fellowship with a congenial mind. No man is ever
found to covet the companionship of those whose
tastes, likings, pursuits, are opposed to his own.
Place one whose character is scarred with dishonour
and his life with impurity, introduce him into the
company of high-souled men&mdash;spirits of sterling integrity
and unblemished virtue, who would recoil
from the contaminating touch of vice, who would
scorn a lie as they would a poisoned dart&mdash;he <em>could</em>
not be happy; he would long to break away from
associates and associations so utterly distasteful and
uncongenial. No man can thirst after God who is
not aiming after assimilation to His character. God
is <small>HOLY</small>. He who thirsts for God must be athirst
for <em>holiness</em>&mdash;he must scorn impurity in all its
forms, in thought, word, and deed. He who longs
for the pure cistern must turn with loathing from
the muddy pools of earth and sin. Again, God is
<small>LOVE</small>. Love is pencilled by Him on every flower,
and murmured in every breeze. The world is resonant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
with chimes of love, and Calvary is love's
crowning triumph and consummation. He who
"thirsts for God" "in him verily is the <em>love</em> of God
perfected." He must have the lineaments in outline,
at least, of a loving nature. He must hate all
that is selfish, delight in all that is beneficent, and
seek an elevating satisfaction in being the minister
of love to others. "<em>He that dwelleth in love dwelleth
in God, and God in him.</em>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And what shall be said to those who know nothing
of this thirst for God,&mdash;to whom all that
is here written is but as an idle tale? You
may pant not for Him. You may have no spiritual
thirst for Him&mdash;no longing for His presence&mdash;no
aspiration after His likeness. But still He is
to you, as to the believer, a <small>LIVING</small> God. Yes&mdash;scorner
of His mercy! ignore the truth as you
may, the God to whom you are responsible,&mdash;the
God with whom you will yet have "to do," <em>that</em> God
<small>LIVES</small>! His eye is upon you&mdash;His book is open&mdash;His
pen is writing&mdash;the indelible page is filling!
You may see no trace of His footstep. You may
hear no tones of His voice. His very mercy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
forbearance may be misconstrued by you, as if it
indicated on His part indifference to His word and
forgetfulness of your sin. You may lull yourselves
into the atheist dream, that the world is governed
by blind chance and fate, that His heaven and His
hell are the forged names and nullities of credulity
and superstition. As you see the eternal monuments
of His power and glory on rock and mountain, you
may affect to see in these only the dead hieroglyphics
of the past&mdash;the obsolete tool-marks of the God of
primeval chaos, who welded into shape the formless
mass, but having done so, left it alone. The scaffolding
is removed, the Architect has gone to uprear
other worlds, and abandoned the completed globe to
the control of universal laws!</p>

<p>Nay&mdash;<span class="smcap">God lives</span>! "He is not far from any
one of us." He is no Baal divinity, "asleep or taking
a journey." The volume of every heart is laid open
to the eye of the great Heart-searcher, and vainly do
you seek to elude His scrutiny. Terrible thought!
this <em>living</em> God <em>against</em> you! <em>You</em> living, and content
to live His enemy! rushing against the bosses
of His buckler! and if you were to die, it would be
in the attitude of one <em>fighting against God</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>No longer scorn His grace or reject His warnings.
He is living; but, blessed be His name, He is living
and waiting to be gracious! You may be as stranded
vessels on the sands of despair; but the tide of His
ocean-love is able to set you floating on the waters.
Repair, without delay, to His mercy-seat. Cast
yourselves on His free forgiveness. Every attribute
of His nature which you have now armed against
you, is stretching out its hand of welcome and entreaty.
Each is like a branch of the tree of life,
inviting you to repose under its shadow. Each is a
rill from the everlasting fountain, inviting you to
drink of the unfailing stream.</p>

<p>See that ye refuse not Him that speaketh. He
who unlocked that fountain is even now standing
by it, and saying, as He contrasts it with all earth's
polluted cisterns, "<em>Whosoever drinketh of</em> <small>THIS</small> <em>water
shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the
water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but
the water that I shall give him shall be in him a
well of water springing up into everlasting life</em>."</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>

<h3>THE TAUNT.</h3>

<p>We are called, in this chapter, to contemplate a
new experience&mdash;David in tears! These, his tears,
brought sin to his remembrance. As, in looking
through the powerful lens of a microscope, the
apparently pellucid drop of water is found to be the
swarming haunt of noxious things,&mdash;fierce animalculÃ¦
devouring one another; so the tears of the
Exile formed a spiritual lens, enabling him to see
into the depths of his own soul, and disclosing, with
microscopic power, transgressions that had long
been consigned to oblivion.</p>

<p>Ten years of regal prosperity had elapsed since
the prophet Nathan, the minister of retribution,
stood before him, in his Cedar Palace, with heavy
tidings regarding himself and his house. Time
may have dimmed the impressions of that meeting.
He may have vainly imagined, too, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
had modified the Divine displeasure. Now that
his head was white with sixty winters, he may have
thought that God would exempt him from further
merited chastisement, and suffer him to go down
to his grave in peace. But the day of reckoning,
which the Divine patience had long deferred, had
now come. He was called to see the first gleamings
of that sword which the anointed prophet had told
him would "never depart from his house." (2 Sam.
xii. 10.) The voice of long averted judgment is at
last heard amid the thickets and caves of Gilead,&mdash;"<em>These
things hast thou done, and I kept silence;
thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one
as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them
in order before thine eyes</em>." (Ps. l. 21.) Nature, in
her august solitudes, echoed the verdict! The waters
murmured it&mdash;the winds chanted it&mdash;the forest
wailed it&mdash;the thunders rolled it&mdash;and the tears of
the lonely Exile himself wept it,&mdash;"<em>Be sure your
sin will find you out</em>!" As he sat by the willows of
Jordan, with his crownless head and aching heart,
he could say, in the words of an older Psalmist,
"<em>We are consumed by Thine anger, and by Thy
wrath are we troubled. Thou has set our iniquities</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
<em>before Thee, our secret sins in the light of Thy
countenance.</em>" (Ps. xc. 7, 8.)</p>

<p>How apt are we to entertain the thought that
God will wink at sin; that He will not be rigidly
faithful to His denunciations&mdash;unswervingly true to
His word. Time's oblivion-power succeeds in erasing
much from the tablets of <em>our</em> memories. We measure
the Infinite by the standard of the finite, and
imagine something of the same kind regarding the
Great Heart-Searcher. Sin, moreover, seldom is, in
this world, <em>instantaneously</em> followed with punishment;
"sentence against an evil work is not executed
speedily;" and the long-suffering patience and
forbearance of the Almighty is presumptuously
construed by perverse natures into alteration or
fickleness in the Divine purpose. But "<em>God is not
a man that He should lie</em>!" Even in this our
present probation state, (oftener than we suppose,)
the time arrives for solemn retribution; when He
makes bare His arm to demonstrate by what an
inseparable law in His moral government He has
connected <em>sin</em> with <em>suffering</em>.</p>

<p>A new missile pierces this panting, wounded
Hart on the mountains of Israel. <em>One</em> of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
hurled the Javelin is specially mentioned in the
sacred narrative. His poisoned dart must have been
rankling in David's soul when he penned this
Psalm.</p>

<p>When the King was descending the eastern slopes
of <em>Olivet</em>, on his way to the Valley of Jordan, Shimei
a Benjamite of Bahurim, of the house of Saul, came
out against him, "<em>and</em>," we read, "<em>cursed still as
he came. And he cast stones at David, and at all
the servants of King David: and all the people and
all the mighty men were on his right hand and on
his left. And thus said Shimei when he cursed,
Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man
of Belial: the Lord hath returned upon thee all the
blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast
reigned; and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom
into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou
art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody
man. And as David and his men went by the way,
Shimei went along on the hill's side over against
him, and cursed him as he went, and threw stones
at him, and cast dust.</em>" (2 Sam. xvi 5-8, 13.) Besides
this son of Gera, there were many obsequious
flatterers and sycophants at Jerusalem&mdash;men once his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
cringing adherents, loud with their hosannahs in the
time of his prosperity&mdash;who had now turned against
him in his adversity, and become the partisans of
the usurper. They exulted over his downfall, and
followed him to the place of exile with the taunting
cry, "Where is now thy God?" "<em>Mine enemies</em>,"
said he, "<em>speak against me; and they that lay wait
for my soul take counsel together, saying,</em> <span class="smcap">God</span> <em>hath
forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there
is none to deliver him</em>." (Ps. lxxi. 10, 11.)</p>

<p>There is no trial keener, no anguish of soul intenser
than this. Let not any talk of taunt and
ridicule being a trivial and insignificant thing&mdash;unworthy
of thought. Let not any say that the
believer, entrenched in a lordly castle&mdash;the very
fortress of God&mdash;should be above the shafts hurled
from the bow of envy, or the venomous arrows from
the tongue of the scoffer. It is often <em>because</em> the
taunt is contemptible that it is hardest to bear.
The sting of the adder rouses into fury the lordly
lion. The tiniest insect blanches the colour of the
loveliest flower, and causes it to hang its pining
head. Sorrow is in itself difficult of endurance, but
bitter is the aggravation when others are ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
make a jest of our sorrows. <em>No water</em> is bad enough
to the fainting pilgrim, but worse is it when he is
mocked by the mirage or bitter pool.</p>

<p>All the more poignant, too, were these taunts in
the case of David, because too well did he know
that such reproaches were merited,&mdash;that he himself
had furnished his enemies with the gall and the
wormwood that had been mingled in his cup. The
dark, foul blots of his past life, he had too good
reason to fear, were now emboldening them to blaspheme.
He had for years been "the Sweet Singer
of Israel;"&mdash;his future destiny was the Psalmist of
the universal Church. His sublime appeals, and
fervent prayers, and holy musings, were to support,
and console, and sustain till the end of time. Millions
on millions, on beds of pain, and in hours of
solitude and times of bereavement, were to have
their faith elevated, their hopes revived, their love
warmed and strengthened by listening to the harp
of the Minstrel King. And now, as his faith begins
to languish, now as a temporary wave of temptation
sweeps him from his footing on the Rock, and the
"Beloved of God" wanders an exile and outcast,&mdash;a
shout is raised by those who were strangers to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
his sublime sources of consolation&mdash;"<em>Where is now
thy God?</em> Where is He whom thou hast sung of
as the help of the godly, the refuge of the distressed?
Where, uncrowned one! is the answer to
thy prayers? Where is He of whom thou didst
boast as being known in all thy Zion palaces as a
refuge? Thou hast taught others and taught thyself
to believe a lie. O Lucifer, son of the morning!
how art thou fallen!"</p>

<p>For the moment, this crushing sarcasm can be
answered by nothing but a flood of anguished tears.
He was below the wave; and though he was soon to
know that below that wave there was an Arm lower
still, yet for the present he was dumb under the
averment. There was no light in the cloud. He
was unable to lay hold of a former comforting experience&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Thou</span>
<em>hast known my soul in adversities</em>."
(Ps. xxxi. 7.)</p>

<p>Oh, how jealous we should be of anything that
would reduce us so low as this, and give a handle to
the adversary! Beware of religious inconsistency.
<em>One</em> fatal step, one unguarded <em>word</em> may undo a
lifetime of hallowed influence. One scar on the
character, one blot on the page of the living epistle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
is indelible. It may be washed away, indeed, by
the blood of sprinkling, so that nothing of it will
remain against you in the book of God; but the
eye and memory of the world, keen to watch and
treasure the inconsistencies of God's people, will not
so easily forgive or forget! The Hart laid itself
open to the toils of the huntsman. It was hit by
the archers. One fierce dart of temptation sped with
unerring aim. It has left the track of blood behind
it in the glades of the forest&mdash;the unbelieving world
hounds in remorseless pursuit, and the taunting cry
will follow to the grave!</p>

<p>Are there any who feel that the experience of
David is their own,&mdash;who either by reason of religious
inconsistency or religious declension have laid
themselves open to the upbraiding question, "<em>Where
is thy God?</em>"&mdash;Perhaps <em>religious declension</em> is the
more common of the two. You are not, as we have
surmised in a previous chapter, what once you were.
You have not the same love of the Saviour as once
you had&mdash;the same confidence in His dealings&mdash;the
same trust in His faithfulness&mdash;the same zeal for
His glory. Affliction, when it comes, does not lead
you, as once it did, to cheerful acquiescence&mdash;to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
cherishing of a meek, unmurmuring submissive
spirit under God's sovereign will and discipline, but
rather to a hasty, misgiving frame&mdash;fretting and
repining when you should be prostrate at the mercy-seat,
saying, "<em>The will of the Lord be done</em>!"</p>

<p>Not in scorn, but in sober seriousness, in Christian
affection and fidelity, we ask, "<em>Where is now
thy God?</em>" "Ye <em>did</em> run well; who hath hindered
you?" What is the guilty cause, the lurking evil,
that has dragged you imperceptibly down from
weakness to weakness, and has left you a poor,
baffled thing, with the finger of irreligious scorn
pointed at you, and whose truthfulness is echoed
back from the lonely voids of your desolate heart?
Return, O backsliding children! Remain no longer
as you are, at this guilty distance from that God
who, amid all the fitfulness of your love to <em>Him</em>, remains
unaltered and unalterable in His love to <em>you</em>.
Be not absorbed in tears, ringing your hands in
moping melancholy&mdash;abandoning yourself to unavailing
remorse and despair. The past may be bad
enough! You may have done foul dishonour to
your God. By some sad and fatal inconsistency, you
may have given occasion to the ungodly to point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
at you the finger of scorn. The fair alabaster pillar
may be stained with some crimson transgression. Or
if there be no special blot to which they can point,
there may be a lamentable spiritual deterioration in
your daily walk. They may have observed your love
to God waxing cold&mdash;your love of the world waxing
strong. They may have heard you murmur at
your Lord's dealings, question His faithfulness, and
refuse to hear and to bear the rod&mdash;manifesting tempers,
or indulging in pursuits sadly and strangely
unlike what would be sanctioned by the example of
your Divine Redeemer. Up! and with determined
energy resolve henceforth to repair the breach,&mdash;henceforth
to make a new start in the heavenly life.
The shrill trumpet sounds&mdash;"<em>Awake, thou that sleepest,
and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give
thee life</em>!" We cannot say, like the King of Nineveh,
"<em>Who can tell if God will turn and repent?</em>"
<em>He</em> has never turned! <em>You</em> have turned from Him,
not He from <em>you</em>. "<em>Where is now thy God?</em>" He
is the same as ever He was;&mdash;boundless in His
compassion&mdash;true to His covenant&mdash;faithful to His
promises; "<em>the same yesterday, and to-day, and
for ever</em>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Reader! if He be afflicting you as He did David;&mdash;if
with an exile spirit you be roaming some
moral wilderness, the flowers of earth faded on your
path, and the bleak winds of desolation and calamity
sweeping and sighing around, let these times
of affliction lead to deep searchings of heart. Let
your tears be as the dewdrops of the morning on the
tender leaves, causing you to bend in lowly sorrow
and self-abasement, only to be raised again, refreshed,
to inhale new fragrance in the summer sun. If,
like the weeping woman of Galilee, you are saying,
through blinding tears, "<em>They have taken away my
Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him</em>,"
&mdash;if, like the Spouse in the Canticles, you are going
about the city in search of your Beloved;&mdash;seeking
Him, He will be found of you. The watchmen may
smite you&mdash;repel you&mdash;tear off your veil&mdash;and load
you with reproaches;&mdash;but "<em>fear not! ye seek Jesus
who was crucified!</em>" He will meet you as He did
the desponding Magdalene, and, listening like her to
His own tones of ineffable love, you will cast yourself
at His feet, and exclaim, "<span class="smcap">Rabboni</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Master!</span>"</p>

<h2>V.</h2>

<h3>THE TAUNT.</h3>

<p>The Great Accuser of the brethren in a variety of
ways attempts to insinuate the same dark doubts in
the minds of believers, which we have spoken of in
the preceding pages. He tries to shake their confidence
in God,&mdash;in the veracity of His word, and the
faithfulness of His dealings. He would lead them to
discover in His providential dispensations what is inconsistent
with His revealed character and will. In
seasons particularly of outward calamity and trouble,
when the body is racked with pain, its nerves unstrung,
or its affections blighted and wounded&mdash;when
the mind is oppressed and harassed, the soul in darkness&mdash;the
Prince of this world, who times his assaults
with such consummate skill, not unfrequently
gains in such seasons a temporary triumph. The
shadow of a cold scepticism passes over the soul. It
is silent under the cry, "<em>Where is thy God?</em>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Have any of you ever known this acutest anguish
of the human spirit,&mdash;those appalling moments of
doubt, when for a moment the whole citadel of
truth seems to rock to its foundations,&mdash;when the
soul becomes a dungeon with grated bars, or in which
the light of heaven is transmitted through distorted
glass, and the finger of unbelief is pointed inwards,
with the old sneer, "Where is the God you were wont
to boast of in your day of prosperity? Where is
there evidence that one prayer you ever offered has
been heard&mdash;one blessing you ever supplicated been
granted&mdash;one evil you ever deprecated been averted
or removed? Where one evidence of His hand in
your allotments in life? These heavens have never
broken silence! Hundreds of years have elapsed
since His voice was last heard. Moreover, you have
only some old parchment leaves written by converted
Pharisees and Galilean fishermen to tell that Deity
ever gave audible utterances out of the thick darkness.
May not His very <em>being</em> be after all a fiction,
a delusion&mdash;His Bible a worn-out figment which
superstition and priestcraft have successfully palmed
upon the world? Or if you do believe in a God and
in a written revelation, have you not good reason, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
all events, to infer from His adverse dealings that He
cares nothing for <em>you</em>. He has proved Himself deaf
to your cries. Where is the mercy in such an affliction
as yours? He has crossed your every scheme,
blasted your fairest gourds. His appointments are
surely arbitrary. He takes useful lives, and leaves
useless ones. He takes the wheat, and leaves the
chaff. The chairs he empties are those of the kind
and good, the loving and beloved. He leaves the
wicked, and proud, and selfish, and profligate. Can
there be a God on the earth? Where is the justice
and judgment which are 'the habitation of His
throne'&mdash;where the 'mercy and the truth' that are
said to 'go before His face?'"</p>

<p>Such, you may say, are awful imaginations&mdash;too
awful to speak of. But such there are! It is the
horror of great darkness&mdash;spirits from the abyss
sent to trouble the pools of ungodly thought, and
stir them from their depths.</p>

<p>Ye who are thus assaulted, do you ever think, in
the midst of these horrible insinuations, of <span class="smcap">One</span>
who had to bear the same? Think of that challenge
which wrung a spotless human soul in the hour of its
deepest anguish&mdash;"<em>He trusted on the Lord that He</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
<em>would deliver him: let Him deliver him, seeing he
delighted in Him</em>." (Ps. xxii. 8.) It was the same
taunt in <em>His</em> case as in yours! It was the cruel,
poignant sneer, that He had, during all his lifetime
of confiding filial love, been trusting to a falsehood,&mdash;that
if God had really been His Father and He
His Son, ten thousands of legions of angels would
have been down now by the side of His cross to unbind
His cords and set the Victim free!</p>

<p>Let the merciful, the wondrous forbearance of
Christ be a lesson to ourselves in the endurance of the
taunts of a scornful world and of the Father of lies.
How easily might He have resented and answered
the challenge by a descent from the cross, by having
the pierced feet and hands set free,&mdash;the crown of
thorns replaced by a diadem of glory, scattering the
scoffing crew like chaff before the whirlwind! But
in meek, majestic silence the Lamb of God suffers
Himself to be bound, the Victim gives no struggle.
Let them scoff on! He will save others, Himself
he will not save! Nor did all their scoffing, their
taunts and ridicule, tend for a solitary moment to
shake His confidence in His heavenly Father. These
fell like spent spray on the Rock of Ages. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the cup of trembling was in His hands, sinking
humanity for the moment seemed to stagger. He
breathed the prayer, "<em>Let it pass from me</em>." But
immediately He added the condition of unswerving
<em>filial trust, "Nevertheless, O my Father, not as</em> I
<em>will, but as</em> <span class="smcap">Thou wilt</span>." Even in the crisis of all,
when He was mourning the eclipse of that Father's
countenance&mdash;in that last gasp of superhuman agony,
He proclaims, in answer to the taunts of earth and
hell, His unshaken trust, "<span class="smcap">My God, my God</span>!"</p>

<p>Comforting surely to the reviled, the ridiculed, and
persecuted, that, severe and poignant as their sorrow
is, they are undergoing only what their Lord and
Master, in an inconceivably more awful form, experienced
before them! Yes! think how He had to
encounter the ingratitude of faithless, the treachery
of trusted friends. The limbs He healed brought no
succour&mdash;the tongues He unloosed lisped no accents
of compassion&mdash;the eyes He unsealed gave no looks
of love. Those lips that spake as never man spake,
dropping wherever they went balm-words of mercy,
now in vain make the appeal to the scoffing crowd,
"<em>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my
friends, for the hand of God hath touched me</em>!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Oh, when in deeper than the water-floods of Gilead,
this wounded <span class="smcap">Hart</span> of Heaven lay panting and
bleeding under the curse,&mdash;when arrow after arrow
was poured upon Him from the shafts of men, and
the bitter cry resounded in His dying ears, <em>Where is
thy God?</em>&mdash;how did He answer? what was His response?
Listen to the apostle's sublime comment on
that scene of blended love and suffering&mdash;"<em>Who,
when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He
suffered, He</em> <span class="smcap">threatened not; but committed
Himself to Him that judgeth righteously</span>."</p>

<p>As the face, the hidden face of God, beamed upon
the Son of His love in the midst of that apparent
desolation, so will it be, children of affliction and
sorrow! with you. Others may see in your tears
nothing but an indication of the desertion of God,&mdash;the
visitations of His wrath and judgment. But
believe it, these very experiences of trouble and
calamity, of bereavement or death, are all meted out
and apportioned for you in love&mdash;drop by drop, tear
by tear. Seek to see God's hand in all that befalls
you. Try, even in the most adverse providences, to
rise above second causes. Be it with you as with
David in his conduct towards Shimei. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
insulting Benjamite was hurling these cruel taunts
against the exiled King and the sorrowing Father,&mdash;when
his incensed soldiers, burning with indignation,
were on the point of drawing their swords and
inflicting summary vengeance on the scoffer&mdash;"<em>Why
should this dead dog</em>," said Abishai, "<em>curse my lord
the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off
his head</em>"&mdash;David's reply is, "Nay! I hear not that
man's voice&mdash;I see not that man's face&mdash;my eye is
above the human instrument, on the God who sent
him&mdash;'<em>Let him curse on, for the Lord hath bidden
him</em>.'" (2 Sam xvi. 11.)</p>

<p>Trust God in the dark. Ah! it is easy for us to
follow Him and to trust Him in sunshine. It is
easy to follow our Leader as Israel did the pillar-cloud,
when a glorious pathway was opened up for
them through the tongue of the Red Sea&mdash;when
they pitched under shady palms and gushing fountains,
and heaven rained down bread on the hungry
camp. But it is not so easy to follow when fountains
fail and the pillar ceases to guide, and all outward
and visible supports are withdrawn. But <em>then</em>
is the time for faith to rise to the ascendant;&mdash;when
the world is loud with its atheist sneer, <small>THEN</small><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
is the time to manifest a simple, child-like trust;
and, amid baffling dispensations and frowning providences,
to exclaim, "<em>Though He slay me, yet will
I trust in Him</em>!"</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;"<em>troubled</em>, we are <small>NOT</small> distressed; <em>perplexed</em>,
we are <small>NOT</small> in <em>despair</em>; <em>persecuted</em>, we are <small>NOT</small> <em>forsaken</em>;
<em>cast down</em>, we are <small>NOT</small> <em>destroyed</em>." We
<small>ARE</small> ready, scoffing world! to answer the question,
<em>Where is thy God?</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Child of Sickness!</span> bound down for years on
that lonely pillow!&mdash;the night-lamp thy companion&mdash;disease
wasting thy cheeks and furrowing thy
brow&mdash;weary days and nights appointed thee&mdash;tell
me, <em>Where is thy God?</em> He is here, is the reply;
His presence takes loneliness from my chamber and
sadness from my countenance. His promises are a
pillow for my aching head,&mdash;they point me onwards
to that better land where "the inhabitant shall no
more say, I am sick!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Child of Poverty!</span> <em>Where is thy God?</em> Can He
visit this rude dwelling? Can God's promises be
hung on these broken rafters? Can the light of His
word illumine that cheerless hearth and sustain that
bent figure shivering over its mouldering ashes?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Yes! He is here. The lips of Truth that uttered
the beatitude, "<em>Blessed be ye poor</em>," have not spoken
in vain. Bound down by chill penury&mdash;forsaken
and forgotten in old age&mdash;no footstep of mercy heard
on my gloomy threshold&mdash;no lip of man to drop the
kindly word&mdash;no hand of succour to replenish the
empty cupboard&mdash;that God above has not deserted
me. He has led me to seek and lay up my treasure
in a home where want cannot enter, and where the
beggar's hovel is transformed into the kingly mansion!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bereaved One!</span> <em>Where is thy God?</em> Where is
the arm of Omnipotence thou wast wont to lean
upon? Has <em>He</em> forgotten to be gracious? Has He
mocked thy prayers, by trampling in the dust thy
dearest and best, and left thee to pine and agonise in
the bitterness of thy swept heart and home? Nay,
He is <em>here</em>! He has swept down my fondest idol,
but it was in order that He himself might occupy
the vacant seat. I know Him too well to question
the faithfulness of His word, and the fidelity of His
dealings. I have never known what a God He was,
till this hour of bitter trial overtook me! There was
a "need be" in every tear&mdash;every death-bed&mdash;every
grave!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dying Man!</span> the billows are around thee&mdash;the
world is receding&mdash;the herald symptoms of approaching
dissolution are gathering fast around thy pillow&mdash;the
soul is pluming its wings for the immortal
flight; ere memory begins to fade, and the mind
becomes a waste,&mdash;ere the names of friends, when
mentioned, will only be answered by a dull, vacant
look, and then the hush of awful silence,&mdash;tell me,
ere the last lingering ray of consciousness and
thought has vanished, <em>Where is thy God?</em></p>

<p>He is here! I feel the everlasting arms underneath
and round about me. Heart and flesh are
failing. The mists of death are dimming my eyes
to the things below, but they are opening on the
magnificent vistas of eternity. <span class="smcap">Yonder</span> He is!
seated amid armies of angels. "<em>My soul thirsteth
for God, for the living God!</em>" "<span class="smcap">This God shall
be my God for ever and ever!</span>"</p>

<h2>VI.</h2>

<h3>SABBATH MEMORIES.</h3>

<p>We always commiserate those who have seen better
days. Poverty, indeed, under any form, appeals
with irresistible power to the sympathies of our
better nature. The most heartless and indifferent
cannot refuse the tribute of pity to the ragged beggar
shivering on the street, or seated in his hovel by the
ashes of a spent fire, brooding over a wretched past,
with the grim spectral forms of want hovering over
a miserable future.</p>

<p>Sad, however, as the condition of such may be,
habit, in one sense, may have become to that squalid
pauper a second nature. He may never have known
a more prosperous state. He may have been inured
from his earliest years to buffet life's wintry storm.
Chill penury may have rocked his cradle, and ever
since sung her rude lullaby over his pallet of straw.
Far more is to be pitied the case of those who have
sunk from comfort into indigence, around whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
early home no bleak winds of adversity ever blew,
who were once pillowed in the lap of plenty if not
of luxury, but who, by some sudden wave of calamity,
have become wrecks on life's desert shore. If
there be one being on God's earth more to be pitied
than another, it is the mother of a once joyous
home, turned adrift, in the hour of her widowhood,
with her ragged children;&mdash;forced to sing, from
door to door, to escape the jaws of hungry famine,&mdash;ill
disguising, under her heap of squalid rags or her
trembling notes of sorrow and despair, the story of
brighter days.</p>

<p>Similar is the commiseration we extend (let the
shores of this Refuge Island of ours bear testimony)
to the hapless patriot or the fallen monarch. These
may have been hurled from positions of influence or
pinnacles of glory more by their crimes than by their
misfortunes. The revolutionary wave that swept
them from their country or their thrones may have
been a just retribution for misrule; but it is their
hour of adversity! They have seen better and more
auspicious times. Pity for the fallen knocks, and
never knocks in vain, at the heart of a great nation's
sympathies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was David's position at this time: Denied
the sympathy of others, his own soul is filled with
recollections of a far different past. The monarch
of Israel, the beloved of God, the idol of his people;
now a fugitive from his capital&mdash;his palace sacked&mdash;his
crown dishonoured&mdash;wandering in ignoble
exile&mdash;a wreck of vanished glory!</p>

<p>But it is not these features of his humiliating fall
on which his mind mainly dwells. It is not the
thought of his sceptre wrested from his grasp&mdash;his
army in mutiny&mdash;his royal residence a den of traitors&mdash;that
fills his soul with most poignant sorrow. He
is an exile from the House of God! The joy of his
old Sabbaths is for the time suspended and forfeited.
No more is the sound of silver trumpets
heard summoning the tribes to the new moons and
solemn feast-days! No more does he behold, in
thought, the slopes of Olivet studded with pilgrim
tents or made vocal with "songs in the night!" No
more does he see the triumphant procession wending
up the hill of Zion&mdash;timbrel and pipe and lute
and voice celebrating in glad accord the high praises
of God;&mdash;"the singers in front, and the players on
instruments behind,"&mdash;he himself, harp in hand, (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
true father of his people,) leading the jubilant chorus,
and Jehovah commanding upon all "the blessing,
even life for evermore!"</p>

<p>How changed! To this Sabbath-loving and Sabbath-keeping
King nothing but the memory of these
remained. "<em>When I remember these things, I pour
out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude,
I went with them to the house of God, with
the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that
kept holy-day.</em>"</p>

<p>Jerusalem was the pride and glory of the Jew.
Wherever he went, he turned to it as to his best
and fondest home. The windows of Daniel's chamber
were "open <em>towards Jerusalem</em>." With his eye
in the direction of the holy city, "<em>he kneeled upon
his knees three times a-day, and prayed, and gave
thanks before his God, as he did aforetime</em>." (Dan.
vi. 10.) Jonah was in the strangest of prisons.
"The depths closed round about him, the weeds
were wrapped about his head, and the earth with its
iron bars." From "the belly of hell" he sent up his
cry to God. "I am cast out of thy sight, yet I will
look again <em>toward thy</em> <small>HOLY TEMPLE</small>." (Jonah ii. 2.)
Captive Israel are seated, in mute despondency, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the willowed banks of the streams of Babylon. The
Euphrates (an ocean river compared with the tiny
streams of Palestine) rolled past them. The city of
the hundred gates rose, like a dream of giant glory,
before their view, with its colossal walls, and towers,
and hanging gardens. Yet what were they in the
eyes of these exile spectators? <em>Shadows</em> of greatness
in comparison with the city and temple of
their fathers amid the hills of Judah! When their
oppressors demanded of them a Hebrew melody,
saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion," they
answered, through hot tears of sorrowful remembrance,
"<em>How shall we sing the Lord's song in a
strange land?</em>" (Ps. cxxxvii. 4.) So it was with
David now. As a bird taken from its home in the
forest and placed in a cage, refuses to warble a joyous
note&mdash;beats its plumage against the enclosing
bars, and struggles to get free,&mdash;so he seems to long
for wings that he may flee away to the hallowed
eaves of the sanctuary, and be at rest!</p>

<p>He himself, indeed, uses a similar figure. He tells
us, in another Psalm, written on this same occasion,
that so blessed did he feel those to be who enjoyed
the privilege of "dwelling in God's house," and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ardent was his longing to participate in their joy,
that he half-envied the swallows who constructed their
nests upon its roof. (Ps. lxxxiv.) He was not without
his solaces in this season of reverse and calamity.
He had many faithful adherents still clinging to him
in his adversity. The best and bravest chieftains
from the tribes on the other side of the Jordan supplied
his drooping followers with the produce of
their rich pasture lands. "<em>Shobi of Ammon, and
Machir of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite</em>"&mdash;these
brought, besides camp utensils, "<em>wheat, and
barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and
lentiles, and parched pulse, and honey, and butter,
and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for
the people that were with him, to eat: for they said,
The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
wilderness.</em>" (2 Sam. xvii. 27-29.) Glorious, too, was
Nature's temple around him. Its pillars the mountains&mdash;the
rocks its altar&mdash;the balmy air its incense&mdash;the
range of Lebanon, rising like a holy of holies,
with its reverend curtain of mist and cloud, and
snowy Hermon towering in solemn grandeur above
all, as the very throne of God! Yet what were these
compared with <span class="smcap">Jerusalem</span>, the place of sacrifice, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
resting-place of the Shekinah-glory, the city of solemnities,
"<em>whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the
Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks
unto the name of the Lord</em>?" (Ps. cxxii. 4.) This
wounded Hart pants for the water-brooks of Zion;
Nature's outer sanctuary had no glory to him, "by
reason of the glory that excelleth." The God who
dwelleth between the cherubim had "<em>chosen Zion,
and desired it for His habitation</em>," saying, "<em>This is
my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have
desired it</em>." (Ps. cxxxii. 13, 14.) With the windows
of his soul, like Daniel, thrown "open <em>towards Jerusalem</em>,"
and his inner eye wistfully straining to
its sunny heights, his ear catching the cadence of
its festive throng, he seems to say, "<em>If I forget thee,
O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to
the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem
above my chief joy.</em>" (Ps. cxxxvii. 5, 6.)</p>

<p>Do we prize the blessing of our Sabbaths and our
sanctuaries? can we say, with somewhat of the emphasis
of this expatriated King&mdash;"<span class="smcap">One</span> <em>thing have
I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I
may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
<em>my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire
in His temple?</em>" Alas! when we are living
in the enjoyment of blessings, too true it is that
we have seldom a vivid sense of their value. He
who is born in a free country, to whom slavery and
oppression are strange words, seldom realises the
priceless boon of liberty. But let him suddenly be
made the victim of tyrant thraldom; let him feel
the irons loading his body, or the worse than material
shackles fettering liberty of thought and action,
and how will the strains of freedom fall like heavenly
music on his ear! When we are in the
enjoyment of health and strength, how little do we
prize the boon. But let us be laid on a bed of
languishing; let the sick lamp flicker for weeks by
the sleepless pillow; let the frame be so shattered
that even the light tread of loving footsteps
across the room quickens the beat of the throbbing
brow. In waking visions of these lonely
night-watches, how does the day of elastic vigour and
unbroken health rise before us! how do we reproach
ourselves that the boon was so long ungratefully
forgotten and unworthily requited! A parent
little knows the strength of the tie which binds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
him to his child during the brief loan of a loved
existence. He gets habituated to the winning ways,
and loving words, and constant companionship. He
comes to regard that little life as part of himself.
He does not fully realise the blessing, because he has
never dreamt of the possibility of its removal. But
when the startling blow comes,&mdash;when death, in
an unexpected moment, has severed the tie,&mdash;when
his eye lights on the empty chair or the unused toy,&mdash;when
the joyous footfall and artless prattling are
heard no more,&mdash;then comes he to gauge all the
depth and intensity of his affection, and to feel how
tenderly (too tenderly!) that idol was enshrined in
his heart of hearts!</p>

<p>So it is with religious privileges. In such a land
as our own, in which, from our earliest infancy, we
have been accustomed to a hallowed Sabbath, an
open sanctuary, an unclasped and unforbidden Bible,
we do not fully estimate the priceless value of the
spiritual blessings bequeathed to us, because never
have we felt the loss or the want of them. But go
to some land of heathenism, where the exiled child of
a British Christian home finds neither minister nor
House of God. Go to the thousands who have betaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
themselves to a voluntary exile amid American
forests or Australian pastures. Or go to the lands
of apostate Christendom, where the Bible is a sealed
book, and religious liberty is an empty name; where
souls thirsting for the living stream are compelled
to drink from some adulterated cistern. Alas!
many in such circumstances are content to sink into
a listless indifference; cold and lukewarm at home,
they are too ready to lapse into the chill of spiritual
death abroad. But there are others who have not
so readily obliterated the holiest records of the past.
Ask many tired and jaded emigrants, conscious of
nobler aspirations than this world can meet, what
recollections, more hallowed than others, linger on
their spirits? They will tell you it is the memory
of the Sabbath rest and the Sabbath sanctuary;
when, at the summons of the village bell, mountain
and glen and hamlet poured forth their multitudes
to the house of God; seated wherein, the burdens and
anxieties, the cares and disquietudes of the work-day
world were hushed and set aside, and in listening to
the words of everlasting life, sorrows were soothed,
faith was revived, and hope brightened. "<em>O God</em>,"
their cry is, "<em>our flesh longeth for Thee in a</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
<em>dry and thirsty land, where no water is; to see Thy
power and Thy glory, so as we have seen Thee in
the sanctuary</em>."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Let us seek to prize our means of grace
while we have them. In a country which is the
reputed palladium of liberty;&mdash;where the greatest
of all liberty, the liberty of the truth, has
been purchased by the blood of our fathers,&mdash;the
time, we trust, with God's help, may never come
when these bulwarks will be overthrown&mdash;when our
sanctuaries will be closed&mdash;our Bibles proscribed&mdash;our
Sabbaths blotted from the statute-book&mdash;and
bigotry, in league with rampant infidelity, again
forge the chain and rear the dungeon. But remember,
that protracted sickness or disease may at any
time overtake us, and debar us from the precious
blessings of the <em>public</em> sanctuary. Yes! I say the
<em>public</em> sanctuary. God's appointed ordinances can
never be superseded or rendered obsolete by human
substitutes. Some may urge that books now-a-days
are better than any preaching;&mdash;that the press is
more potent and eloquent than any living voice.
But church or pulpit is not a thing of man's device.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
It is a divine institute. The speaker is an <em>ambassador</em>
in his Master's name, charged with a vast mission
from the court of high heaven, and the House of
God is the appointed audience-chamber. God does
not, indeed, (nay, far from it,) forsake "the dwellings
of Jacob." The lowliest cottage-home may become a
<em>Bethel</em>, with a ladder of love set between earth and
heaven, traversed by ministering angels! The secluded
sick-chamber may become a <em>Patmos</em>, bright
with manifestations of the Redeemer's presence and
grace! But, nevertheless, "<em>Thy way, O God, is in
the sanctuary</em>." The promise remains, "I will make
my people joyful in my <em>house of prayer</em>." It is the
solemn "trysting-place"&mdash;the pledged ground of
covenant intercommunion. "<span class="smcap">There</span> <em>I will meet with
thee, and commune with thee from off my mercy-seat!"
"The Lord loveth the gates of Zion!"
"How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy
tabernacles, O Israel!</em>"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Reader, let me ask, How stands it with you? Are
you conscious of a reverential regard and attachment
to God's holy place? Does the return of the
Sabbath awake in your heart the old melody of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sweet singer of Israel,&mdash;"<em>This is the day which the
Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in
it</em>?"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Do you go to the solemn assembly, not to hear
the <em>messenger</em> but the <em>message</em>;&mdash;not to pay homage
to a piece of dust, (the vilest and most degraded
form of idolatry,) but feeling yourself a beggar in
the sight of God, with a soul to save, and an eternity
to provide for? Do you approach it as the <em>place
of prayer</em>, over which the cloud hovers laden with
spiritual blessings? Do you go to it as "<em>the house
of God</em>," seeking fellowship and communion with
the Father of spirits; desiring that all its services&mdash;its
devotions, and praises, and exhortations&mdash;may
become hallowed magnets, drawing you nearer and
binding you closer to the mercy-seat? Oh, let not
the boon of Sabbath privileges degenerate into an
empty form, the mere pageant of custom. Let the
Sabbath hours be sacredly kept. Let their lessons
be sacredly treasured. Let their close find you a Sabbath-day's
journey nearer heaven. Let their hallowed
fragrance follow you through the week. Let them
be landmarks in the pilgrimage; towering behind you
the further you go&mdash;like Alp piled on Alp, flushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
with roseate light, guiding and cheering you when
low down in the valleys of trial and sorrow, and when
called to descend the last and gloomiest Valley of all.</p>

<p>David is mourning, in the words which have given
rise to these thoughts, over his altered Sabbath joys.
It may be there are some reading these pages, who,
though they know nothing like him of literal exile
and banishment from the sanctuary, may yet be
able painfully to participate in his feelings! They
are seated, Sabbath after Sabbath, in their pews;
their Bibles are in their hands&mdash;the living words of
the preacher are sounding in their ears; but their
experience may be best interpreted by the language
of the Christian poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Where is the blessedness I knew</div>
<div class="indent1">When first I saw the Lord?</div>
<div class="line">Where is the soul-refreshing view</div>
<div class="indent1">Of Jesus and His Word?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"How blest the hours I once enjoy'd!</div>
<div class="indent1">How sweet their memory still!</div>
<div class="line">But they have left an aching void</div>
<div class="indent1">The world can never fill."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Memory can travel back on Sabbaths and communion
seasons when a sunshine of holy joy irradiated
their spirits; when their Sabbath was one hallowed
Emmaus-journey;&mdash;they, during its sanctuary-hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
travelling side by side with Jesus, and He causing
their hearts, as He did those of the disciples of old,
to "burn within them." They were wont to come
and depart, saying, "<em>This is none other than the
house of God; this is the gate of heaven</em>." Now
they feel that all is sorrowfully altered. They have
comparatively no joy, as once they had, when the
Sabbath morning dawns. When they seat themselves
in church, there is no fervour in their praises&mdash;no
earnestness in their prayers&mdash;no childlike
teachableness in hearing. There is more criticising
of the preacher than worshipping God. There is no
living flame on the heart-altar; their befitting exclamation
is that of the prophet, "<em>My leanness!
my leanness!</em>" They are ready, in the bitterness
of their spirits, to say, "<em>When I remember these
things, my soul is poured out within me</em>."</p>

<p>Sad it is to have <em>no</em> meat; but sad, too, when
we <em>have</em> food and cannot enjoy it! Sad it is, as
exiles in a strange land, to have no Sabbath-gates
flung open to us, and no Sabbath-bells to
welcome the day of God; but sadder still to have
these solemn chimes within hearing;&mdash;to have our
sanctuaries open, and faithful ministers proclaiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the words of eternal life, and yet to listen with the
adder's ear;&mdash;to listen as the dead in our churchyards
listen to the tears and laments of the living!</p>

<p>What should be done in such a case as this?
Trace the muddy and turgid stream to its source.
Discover what earthly clouds are dimming the
spiritual firmament, and hiding the shinings of the
Divine countenance. Sin, in some shape or other,
must be the fruitful cause. It may be some positive
and persevered-in transgression; indulgence in
which, shuts up the avenues of prayer, and denies
all access to the mercy-seat. Or it may be some
no less culpable sin of <em>omission</em>. That mercy-seat
may have become unfrequented; the rank grass may
be waving over its once beaten foot-road; the altar-fire
languishing in the closet, must necessarily
languish in the sanctuary too. How can the House
of God be now fragrant with blessing, if the life is
spent in guilty estrangement from <em>Him</em>? Religion
cannot be worn as a Sabbath garment, if garments
soiled with sin be worn throughout the week.</p>

<p>Self-exile from the joys of the sanctuary! return
henceforth to God. If it be positive sin which is
marring former blessedness, cast out the troubler in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Israel. If it be duties omitted, or perfunctorily discharged,
return to former earnest-mindedness. Cultivate
more filial nearness to the Hearer of prayer.
Seek, on your bended knees, to obtain more tenderness
of conscience regarding sin;&mdash;to have more
longing aspirations after the beauties of holiness.</p>

<p>And <em>delay</em> not the return. By doing so, the
growing languor and listlessness which is creeping
over you, may settle into positive disrelish of God's
house. Imitate the example of the Spouse in the
Canticles, who, in mourning over similar spiritual declension,
resolves on an <em>instantaneous</em> seeking of the
forfeited presence of her Lord. "<em>Tell me, O thou
whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou
makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be
as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</em>"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Go with the words which this exile of
Gilead employs in the sequel to this Psalm, written on
the same occasion&mdash;"<em>O send out Thy light and Thy
truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto Thy
holy hill, and to Thy tabernacles. Then will I go
unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Yes! go, and prove what the God of the sanctuary
can do in the fulfilment of His own promise. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
seems now to be saying, "Put me to the test."
"<em>Prove me now herewith, if I will not open you
the windows of heaven, and pour you out a
blessing, that there shall not be room enough to
receive it.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Every church is a <em>Peniel</em>, where God
meets His people, as He met the patriarch of old
at the brook Jabbok. Go and see what may be
effected by <em>one</em> lowly, humble, seeking soul&mdash;some
wrestling Jacob, who, like "a Prince," has "power
with God, and prevails!" The lowliest tabernacle
on earth is glorified as being the <em>House of God</em>&mdash;the
dwelling-place of Omnipotence and Love&mdash;the
hallowed "<em>home</em>," where a loving Father waits to
dispense to His children the garnered riches of His
grace! The time may come when the holy and
beautiful sanctuary where we worship may become
a heap of ruins. The fire may lay it in ashes&mdash;the
hand of man may raze it&mdash;the slower but surer hand
of time may corrode its walls and crumble its solid
masonry stone by stone; but as sure as it is God's
own appointed treasure-house of spiritual mercies,
may we not believe that there will be deathless
spirits who will be able to point to it in connexion
with imperishable memories,&mdash;"buildings of God,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
"eternal in the heavens," beyond the reach of human
violence, and wasting elements, and corroding years?
Does not the promise stand unrepealed in this Bible;&mdash;let
it ever be the inscription on our temples of
worship,&mdash;"<em>Of</em> <small>ZION</small> <em>it shall be said, This and that
man was born in her; and the Highest himself shall
establish her. The Lord shall count, when He writeth
up the people, that this man was born there?</em>"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Oh that ours may at last be the blessedness of
that better Church above, which knows no banishment,
no exile, no languor, no weariness;&mdash;where
"the holy-day" is an eternal Sabbath;&mdash;the festive
throng, "a multitude which no man can number"&mdash;the
voice of joy and praise, "everlasting songs;"&mdash;where
God's absence can never be deplored;&mdash;where
He who now tendeth His temple-lamps on earth,
feeding them day by day with the oil of His grace,
removing the rust perpetually gathering over them
by reason of their contact with sin, will, with the
plenitude of His own presence, supersede all earthly
luminaries, and ordinances, and sanctuaries;&mdash;for
"<em>they need no candle, neither light of the sun, for
the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall
reign for ever and ever</em>!"</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>

<h3>HOPE.</h3>

<p>Take the wings from a bird, and it is the most
helpless of animals. Bring the eagle from his eyrie,
and rob him of his plumage, and he who an hour
before was soaring monarch of the sky, is more
powerless than the worm crawling at his side, or
than the bleating lamb that trembled and cowered
under his shadow.</p>

<p>Such was David now. The wounded bird of Paradise
flutters in the dust. The taunting cry everywhere
assails him, "<em>Where is thy God?</em>" The
future is a mournful blank, and the past is crowded
with joyous and happy memories, which only aggravate
and intensify the sorrows of the present.</p>

<p>But though soiled and mutilated, the wings of
faith are not broken. He struggles to rise from his
fall. In the verse we are now to consider, he plumes
his pinions for a new flight. We found him a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
time before, making his tears a microscopic lens,
looking through them into the depths of his own
sorrowing and sinning heart. So long as he does
so, there is ground for nothing but misgiving and
despair. But he reverses the lens. He converts
the microscope into a telescope. In self-oblivion,
he turns the prospect-glass away from his own
troubles and sorrows, his fitful frames and feelings,
his days alike of sunshine and shade, to Him who is
above all mutation and vicissitude. In this position,
with his eye God-wards, he begins to interrogate his
own spirit as to the unreasonableness of its depression.
He addresses a bold remonstrance to guilty
unbelief. In the preceding verse, he alluded to the
dense multitude&mdash;the many thousands of Israel&mdash;he
was wont to lead in person to the feasts of Zion.
Now he is alone with one auditor&mdash;that auditor is
<small>HIMSELF</small>. "<em>Why art thou cast down</em>, <span class="smcap">O my soul</span>?"</p>

<p>And what is his antidote? What is the balm
and balsam he applies to his wounded spirit?
"<em>Hope thou in God!</em>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope!</span> Who is insensible to the music of that
word? What bosom has not kindled under its
utterance? Poetry has sung of it; music has warbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
it; oratory has lavished on it its bewitching
strains. Pagan mythology, in her vain but beautiful
dreams, said that when all other divinities fled
from the world, <em>Hope</em>, with her elastic step and
radiant countenance and lustrous attire, lingered
behind. <span class="smcap">Hope!</span> well may we personify thee, lighting
up thy altar-fires in this dark world, and dropping
a live coal into many desolate hearts; gladdening
the sick-chamber with visions of returning health;
illuminating with rays, brighter than the sunbeam,
the captive's cell; crowding the broken slumbers of
the soldier by his bivouac-fire, with pictures of his
sunny home, and his own joyous return. <span class="smcap">Hope!</span>
drying the tear on the cheek of woe! As the black
clouds of sorrow break and fall to the earth, arching
the descending drops with thine own beauteous
rainbow! Ay, more, standing with thy lamp in
thy hand by the gloomy realms of Hades, kindling
thy torch at Nature's funeral pile, and opening
vistas through the gates of glory!</p>

<p>If Hope, even with reference to present and finite
things, be an emotion so joyous,&mdash;if uninspired
poetry can sing so sweetly of its delights, what
must be the <em>believer's</em> hope, the hope which has God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
for its object, and heaven its consummation? How
sweet that strain must have sounded from the lips
of the exile Psalmist amid these glens of Gilead!
A moment before, his sky is dark and troubled, but
blue openings begin once more to tremble through
the clouds. The mists have been hanging dense
and thick, hiding out the water-brooks. But now
the sun shines. They rise and circle in wreaths of
fantastic vapour, disclosing to the wounded Hart
"the springs in the valleys which run among the
hills; which give drink to every beast in the field,
and where the wild asses quench their thirst." The
wilderness has become once more "a pool of water,
and the dry land springs of water." Rebuking his
unworthy tears, Faith once more takes down her
harp, and thus wakes its melodies,&mdash;"<em>I wait for the
Lord, my soul doth wait, and in His word do I</em>
<small>HOPE</small>." "<em>Let Israel</em> <small>HOPE</small> <em>in the Lord.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>And is it not well for us from time to time to
open the gates of our own souls, and hold a similar
consistory?&mdash;to make solemn inquisition with our
hearts in their seasons of trouble and disquietude?</p>

<p>"<em>Why art thou cast down?</em>" Is it outward trial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that assails thee? Has calamity abridged thy
earthly comforts? Have the golden heaps thou
mayest have been a lifetime in amassing, dissolved
like a snow-wreath;&mdash;the waxen wings of capricious
fortune, when thou wast soaring highest,
melting like those of fabled Icarus of old, and
bringing thee helpless to the ground? Or is it
sickness that has dulled thine eye, paralysed thy
limb, and ploughed its furrows on thy cheek; shutting
out from thee the din of a busy world, and
chaining thee down to a couch of languishing? Or
is it the treachery of thy trusted friend that has
wounded thee; blighting thine affections, crushing
thy hopes, dashing thy cup of earthly bliss to the
ground? Or is it bereavement that has made gaps
in thy loved circle; torn away the fixtures which
gave thy dwelling and life itself all its gladness
and joy?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hope</span> <em>thou in</em> <span class="smcap">God</span>." The creature has perished.
God is imperishable! Thou mayest be saying in
the bitterness of thy spirit, "<em>All these things are
against me</em>;" there may be no gleam of light in
the tempest, no apparent reason for the dark dispensation;
you feel it is with stammering lips and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a misgiving heart you give utterance to the reluctant
word, "Thy will be done." But, "<em>My soul,
wait thou only upon God</em>;" (or, as Calvin translates
this, "<em>Be silent</em> before God;") "<em>for my expectation
is from Him</em>."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> "<em>Commit also thy way unto the
Lord, and He shall bring it to pass.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Here is
the province of faith,&mdash;<em>implicit trust</em> in dark dealings.
God brings His people into straits; sends
often what is baffling and unaccountable, to lead
them devoutly to say, "<em>Though He slay me, yet will
I trust in Him</em>." Oh, beautiful is it thus to see
<span class="smcap">Hope</span> sitting, like the sea-bird, calmly on the crested
wave! While others (strangers to the peace of the
gospel) are beating their breasts in tumultuous
grief, indulging in wild paroxysms of rebellious
sorrow,&mdash;beautiful is it to see the smitten one prostrate
at the feet of the great <span class="smcap">Chastener</span>, saying
through tear-drops of resignation, "<em>Even so, Father;
for so it seems good in Thy sight!</em>" Believe it, in
the apparently rough voice of thy God, there is, as
in the case of Joseph to his brethren, tones of dissembled
love, disguised utterances of affection&mdash;"<em>Although
thou sayest thou canst not see Him, yet</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
<em>judgment is before Him; therefore trust thou in
Him.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Besides, this lofty grace of Hope requires stern
discipline to bring it into exercise, and to develop
its noble proportions. It is the child of tribulation.
The apostle thus traces its pedigree&mdash;"<em>Tribulation
worketh patience; and patience, experience; and
experience,</em> <span class="smcap">Hope</span>."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> As there can be no rainbow
in the natural heavens without the cloud, so Hope
cannot span the moral firmament, with its triumphal
arch, without the clouds of tribulation. As
the mother eagle is said, when other expedients fail,
to put a thorn in the side of her nest to urge her
young brood to fly, so tribulation is the thorn which
drives Hope to the wing.</p>

<p>"<em>And thou shalt yet praise Him.</em>" "<span class="smcap">Yet!</span>" We
cannot venture to scan or measure that word. It
may be after many bitter tears of sorrow;&mdash;it may
be after many struggles with a murmuring heart;&mdash;many
storms may still sweep&mdash;many hours of pining
sickness may be endured&mdash;many a rough and thorny
path may have to be trodden&mdash;the harp may be
muffled in sadness to the last; but, "<em>at evening-time</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
<em>it shall be light</em>." There is a season infallibly
coming when the fettered tongue shall be loosed&mdash;the
lingering cloud dispelled&mdash;and faith's triumph
complete; when, with regard to the very dispensation
on earth which caused you so much perplexity,
you will be able triumphantly to say, "<em>I know</em>"
(yea, I <small>SEE</small>) "<em>that Thy judgments are right, and
that Thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me</em>."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>But your depression may proceed from a different
cause. It may not be outer trial, but inward sources
of disquietude which are causing despondency and
doubt. It may be thoughts regarding your <em>spiritual</em>
condition. Latent corruption in a partially renewed
and sanctified heart,&mdash;the power of remaining sin
robbing you of your peace; at times leading you
to question whether you have any real interest in
Gospel blessings and Gospel hopes&mdash;whether you
have not long ago quenched the strivings of the
Holy Spirit by your impenitence and unbelief&mdash;whether
your hopes of heaven may not after all be
a shadowy delusive dream. "<em>Why art thou cast
down, O my soul?</em>" Who, I ask, is teaching you
to breathe out these penitential sighings after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
happiness to which at present you feel you are a
stranger? Who is it that is teaching you thus to
interrogate yourself about the erring past? It is
not <em>Nature's</em> work. If there be within you one
true breathing after repentance and return, that
secret aspiration is the work of that Spirit who,
although He will not always strive, is hereby shewing
you that He <em>is</em> striving still with <em>you</em>! Think
of all that God hath done for you in the past,
and is still willing to do. After the gift of His
Son,&mdash;after such an expenditure of wrath and suffering
on the head of a guiltless Surety, and all this
that a way of reconciliation might be opened up,&mdash;think
how dishonouring it would be to distrust
either His ability or His willingness to save you.
Having bestowed this greatest boon, He will "with
Him also <em>freely</em> give you <em>all things</em>." Turn away
from self,&mdash;sinful self, righteous self, condemned self,&mdash;and
direct your believing regards to Him who is
"<em>the</em> <span class="smcap">Hope</span> <em>of Israel and the Saviour thereof</em>." Keep
your eye steadily fixed on the infinite grandeur of
His finished work and righteousness. Look to Jesus
and believe! Look to Jesus and live! Nay, more;
as you look to Him, hoist your sails, and buffet manfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the sea of life. Do not remain in the haven of
distrust, or sleeping on your shadows in inactive repose,
or suffering your frames and feelings to pitch
and toss on one another like vessels idly moored in a
harbour. The religious life is not a brooding over
emotions, grazing the keel of faith in the shallows, or
dragging the anchor of hope through the oozy tide-mud,
as if afraid of encountering the healthy breeze.
Away! with your canvas spread to the gale, trusting
in Him who rules the raging of the waters.
The safety of the timid bird is to be on the wing,
if its haunt be near the ground,&mdash;if it fly low, it
exposes itself to the fowler's net or snare. If we
remain grovelling on the low ground of feeling
and emotion, we shall find ourselves entangled in
a thousand meshes of doubt and despondency,
temptation and unbelief. "<em>But surely in vain
the net is spread in the sight of</em> <small>THAT WHICH
HATH A WING</small>"<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;(marginal reading.) "<em>They that
wait (or hope) in the Lord shall renew their
strength; they shall mount up with wings as
eagles.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope</span> strengthens and invigorates her pinions the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
higher she soars. She gathers courage from the
past, and looks with eagle eye to the future. "<em>I
know</em>," says Paul, "<em>in whom I have believed</em>," (hoped,
or trusted,) "<em>and am persuaded that He is able to
keep that which I have committed unto Him</em>." "<em>I
will hope continually</em>," says David, "<em>and will yet
praise Thee more and more</em>."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Again, using a kindred
emblem&mdash;the bird in the tempest rushing for
shelter under the mother's wing&mdash;"<em>Thou hast</em> <small>BEEN</small>
<i>my help,</i> <small>THEREFORE</small> <em>in the shadow of Thy wings
will I rejoice</em>."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Can such be said of the world's hopes? Does
experience lead to repose in <em>them</em> with similar implicit
confidence? <em>Hope</em>&mdash;the hope of earthly good,
and earthly joy, and earthly happiness&mdash;is often (too
often) the mirage of life; the bubble on the stream,
tinted with evanescent glory, a flash of prismatic
beauty, and then <em>gone</em>! Multitudes flock to this
enchantress in her cave, and though mocked and
duped, and mocked and duped again, still they
haunt her oracle, and kiss her magic wand. She
has built for them again and again air castles&mdash;turret
on turret, buttress on buttress, gilded dome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and glittering minaret, and these have melted like
frost-work. But yet these Babel builders, with the
same avidity as ever, return to the work, and again
the fantastic battlements are piled high in mid air!</p>

<p>We do not condemn these noble aspirations and
struggles of this noble emotion;&mdash;far from it. What
would the world be without Hope? It is the oil
which keeps its vast machinery in play; it is the
secret of all success&mdash;the incentive to all enterprise.
Annihilate hope, and you blot out a sun from the
firmament. Annihilate hope, and the husbandman
would forsake his furrow, the physician his patient,
the merchant his traffic; the student would quench
his midnight lamp; science would at this hour have
been lisping its alphabet, and art and philosophy
would have been in their infancy.</p>

<p>But this we say, that if so much is perilled on a
peradventure;&mdash;if <em>hope</em>&mdash;the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> of earth&mdash;be
so greedily pursued,&mdash;why the cold and careless
indifference regarding "the hope which maketh not
ashamed"&mdash;the hope which is beyond the possibility
of disappointment; promises which never fail;
words which rest on a firmer and surer basis than
the foundations of earth and the pillars of heaven?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Shall the disappointed hewer still go on patching
the shivered and broken <em>earthly</em> cistern? Shall the
man of science, undeterred by successive failures,
pursue his unwearied analysis? Shall the merchant
remain unbaffled by adverse markets that have
drained his coffers, or successive storms that have
stranded his vessels and wrecked his cargo? Shall
the fragments of a brave army re-muster at the
bugle call, and, amid dying comrades around and a
shower of iron hail in front, return with undaunted
hearts to the charge? Shall pining captives in a
beleaguered garrison, pressed by famine, decimated
by disease, outnumbered by force&mdash;shall these light
their beacon-fires of <em>hope</em>, and sit to the last by
their smouldering ashes, struggling on, either till
calm endurance win its recompence, or until hope
and life expire together? And shall the spiritual
builder, or merchant, or soldier, be left alone coward
and faint-hearted, and give way to unworthy distrust,
or pusillanimous despair; and that, too, when
the guarantees of <em>their</em> hope are so amazing?
Listen to them! What words could be stronger?
what pledges more inviolable? "<span class="smcap">In hope</span> <em>of eternal
life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
<em>the world began.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> "<em>Wherein God, willing more
abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the
immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by an
oath: that by two immutable things, in which it
was impossible for God to lie, we might have a
strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay
hold upon the hope set before us: which hope we
have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
steadfast, and which entereth into that within the
veil.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Oh, beautiful figure! Hope casts its anchor into
the Rock of Ages within the veil. The ship may be
tossing in the surging sea below, but a chain of everlasting
love and grace links it to the throne of God.</p>

<p>I love to walk through the Bible, and gaze on
its many delineations of <em>Hope</em>. It is a picture-gallery
of this noble grace! As the great painters of
the middle ages clung to favourite subjects, so <span class="smcap">Hope</span>
seems ever to meet us in some form or other, as we
tread this long corridor of inspired portraits.</p>

<p>Here is the earliest. A picture hung in a framework
of sorrow. Its subject is two drooping exiles
going with tears out of Eden. But, lo! a tinge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
light gleams in the dark sky, and the angel of <em>Hope</em>
drops in their ears healing words of comfort.</p>

<p>Here is another. An ark is tossed in a raging
deluge. The heavens are black above. Neither
sun nor stars appear. All around is a waste wilderness
of waters. But, lo! by the window of the ark
a weary bird is seen fluttering, and bearing in its
mouth an olive branch of <em>Hope</em>!</p>

<p>Here, again, is a picture called "<em>The Father of the
Faithful</em>." Its subject is a solitary pilgrim, one of
the world's gray patriarchs. He is treading along
amid some wild pastoral hills, all ignorant of his
destiny; but he has a staff in his hand&mdash;it is the
staff of <em>Hope</em>!</p>

<p>Here is another. It is an Arabian Emir, once a
Prince of the East, sitting amid ashes, the victim of
a loathsome disease; and worse than all, of Satanic
power. But <em>Hope</em> tunes his lips to sing, "<em>I know
that my Redeemer liveth</em>."</p>

<p>Here is a vast exodus of six hundred thousand
slaves from a land of bondage, separated by an
inhospitable desert from the land of their fathers;
but <em>Hope</em> silvers the edges of their pillar of cloud,
and gleams by night in their pillar of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is another picture, of exiled patriots seated
by the waters of Babylon. They have hung their
harps on the willows. They refuse to sing the
Lord's song in that strange land. But <span class="smcap">Hope</span> is
represented restoring the broken strings; and with
their eyes suffused with tears, yet glistening with
joyous visions, thus they pour out their plaintive
prayer&mdash;"<em>Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the
streams in the south.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Time would fail to traverse these halls and walls
of ancient memory. <span class="smcap">Hope</span>, in every diversified
form and attitude, is portrayed in the history of the
glorious company of the apostles, the goodly fellowship
of prophets, the noble army of martyrs,&mdash;ay,
sustaining too, in the midst of His sufferings and
sorrows, the very bosom of the Son of God&mdash;for
was it not <em>hope</em> ("the joy that was set before Him")
that made Him "endure the cross, despising the
shame?"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>And what <em>Hope</em> has proved in the history of the
Church collectively, it is in the life of every individual
believer. By nature he is a "prisoner," but "a prisoner
of hope."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The gospel is a "gospel of hope." Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
message is called "<em>the good hope through grace</em>."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
The God of the gospel is called "<em>the God of
Hope</em>."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The "helmet of salvation" is the helmet of
"<em>hope</em>."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The "anchor of the soul" is the anchor
of "<em>hope</em>."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The believer "<em>rejoices in hope</em>,"<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and
"<em>abounds in hope</em>."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> <em>Christ is in him</em> "<em>the hope
of glory</em>."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> <span class="smcap">Hope</span> peoples to him the battlements
of heaven with sainted ones in the spirit-land.
He "sorrows not as others, who have no <span class="smcap">Hope</span>."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
When death comes, <em>Hope</em> smoothes his dying pillow,
wipes the damps from his brow, and seals his eyes.
"<em>Now, Lord, what wait I for? my <span class="smcap">hope</span> is in
Thee.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> <em>Hope</em> stands with her torch over his grave,
and in the prospect of the dust returning to its dust,
he says, "<em>My flesh shall rest in hope.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> <em>Hope</em> is
one of three guardian graces that conduct him to
the heavenly gate. Now abideth these three, "Faith,
<span class="smcap">Hope</span>, and Love," and if it be added, "<em>the greatest of
these is Love</em>," it is because Hope and her companion
finish their mission at the celestial portal! They
proceed no further, they go back to the world, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
wrestlers in the earthly conflict. Faith returns to
her drooping hearts, to undo heavy burdens, and
to let the oppressed go free. <em>Hope</em> goes to her
dungeon vaults, her beds of sickness, her chambers
of bereavement and sorrow. To take Faith or Hope
to heaven, would be to take the Physician to the
sound man, or to offer crutches to the strong, or to
help to light the meridian sun with a tiny candle;
<em>Faith</em> is then changed to sight, and Hope to full
fruition. <span class="smcap">Love</span> alone holds on her infinite mission.
<em>Faith</em> and <em>Hope</em> are her two soaring pinions. She
drops them as she enters the gates of glory. The
watcher puts out his beacon when the sun floods
the ocean&mdash;the miner puts out his lamp when he
ascends to the earth. <em>Hope's</em> taper light is unneeded
in that world where "the sun shall no more
go down, neither for brightness shall the moon
withdraw itself, but where the Lord our God shall
be an everlasting light, and the days of our mourning
shall be ended."</p>

<h2>VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE HILL MIZAR.</h3>

<p>In the preceding verse, we found the Psalmist chiding
his soul for the unreasonableness of its depression&mdash;calling
upon it to exercise hope and trust in
God, under the assurance that he would "yet praise
Him for the help of His countenance."</p>

<p>But "<em>what will ye see in the Shulamite</em>?" Another
experience testifies afresh, "<em>As it were the
company of two armies.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> <span class="smcap">Hope</span> has no sooner
risen to the surface than despondency returns. The
struggling believer threatens to sink. The wave is
again beat back. His soul is again "cast down!"
But one word&mdash;an old monosyllable of comfort&mdash;is
borne on the refluent billow, "<span class="smcap">O my God!</span>" This
"strong swimmer in his agony" seizes hold of that
never-failing support, the faithfulness of a covenant-keeping
Jehovah. With this he breasts the opposing
tide, and will assuredly at last reach the shore.
The very tribulations that are casting him down,&mdash;threatening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to submerge him,&mdash;are only nerving his
spirit for bolder feats; leading him to value more
the everlasting arms that are lower and deeper than
the darkest wave.</p>

<p>We have heard of a bell, set in a lighthouse, rung
by the sweep of the winds and the dash of the billows.
In the calm, stormless sea, it hung mute and
motionless; but when the tempest was let loose and
the ocean fretted, the benighted seaman was warned
by its chimes; and beating hearts ashore, in the fisherman's
lonely hut, listened to its ominous music.
We read in the previous verse, of the lighthouse of
<span class="smcap">Faith</span>, built on the rock of <span class="smcap">Hope</span>. God has placed
bells there. But it needs the storms of adversity
to blow ere they are heard. In the calm of uninterrupted
prosperity, they are silent and still. But the
hurricane arises. The sea of life is swept with tempest,
and, amid the thick darkness, they ring the peal
of heavenly confidence, "<span class="smcap">My God, my God!</span>"</p>

<p><em>My God!</em> What a heritage of comfort do these
words contain&mdash;in all time of our tribulation&mdash;in all
time of our wealth&mdash;in the hour of death, and at the
day of judgment! They describe the great Being who
fills heaven with His glory, as the covenant portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and heritage of believers. His attributes are embarked
on their side; His holiness and righteousness,
and justice and truth, are the immutable
guarantees and guardians of their everlasting well-being.
Hear His own gracious promise&mdash;"<em>I will
bring the third part through the fire, and will refine
them as silver is refined, and will try them as
gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I
will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and
they shall say, The Lord is my God.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Moreover,
He is the only possession which is theirs <em>absolutely</em>.
All else they have, is in the shape of a loan, which
they receive as stewards. Their time, their talents,
their possessions, their friends, are only <em>leased</em> by
them from the Great Proprietor of life and being.
But they <em>can</em> say unreservedly, "<em>The Lord is my
portion.</em>" "<em>God, even our</em> <small>OWN</small> <em>God, shall bless
us.</em>" Ay, and we are told, "<em>God is not ashamed
to be called</em> <span class="smcap">their God</span>."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> "The <em>name</em> of the
Lord" is thus "a strong tower: the righteous runneth
into it, and is safe."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> That salvation purchased
by Jesus,&mdash;the amazing method by which
every attribute of the Divine nature has been magnified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and every requirement of the Divine law
has been met,&mdash;is "for walls and bulwarks." The
believer not only can lay hold on higher blessings&mdash;"the
good hope through grace," "glory, honour,
immortality, eternal life,"&mdash;but even with regard to
the circumstantials of the present, the appointments
and allotments in the house of his pilgrimage, he
can feel that they are so regulated and overruled as
best to promote his spiritual interests; and that "all
things" (yes, "<small>ALL</small> things") are "working together
for his good." Take then, desponding one! the
opening words of David's lamentation. They quiet
all apprehensions. This all-gracious Being who gave
His own Son for thee, must have some wise reason
in such discipline. Oh, confide all thy perplexities,
and <em>this</em> perplexity, into His hands, saying, "<em>I am
oppressed, undertake</em> <span class="smcap">Thou</span> <em>for me!</em>" Who can
forget that it was this same monosyllable of comfort
that cheered a greater Sufferer at a more awful hour?
The two most memorable spots in His midnight of
agony,&mdash;Gethsemane and Calvary, the Garden and
the Cross,&mdash;have this solitary gleam of sunshine
breaking through the darkness, "<span class="smcap">O my Father!</span>"
"<span class="smcap">My God, my God!</span>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now proceed to the main feature in this
verse. We have already noted how the exiled King
had tried to reason his soul out of its depression
by the exercise of <span class="smcap">Hope</span>&mdash;by looking beyond the
shadows of the present to a brighter <em>future</em>. But
the torch flickered and languished in his hand. He
adopts a new expedient. Instead of looking to the
<em>future</em>, he resolves to take a <em>retrospective</em> survey;
he directs his eye to the <em>past</em>. As often at eventide,
when the lower valleys are in shadow, the
mountain-tops are gilded with the radiance of the
setting sun; so from the Valley of Humiliation,
where he now was, he looks back on the lofty
memorials of God's faithfulness. He "<em>lifts his eyes
unto the</em> <small>HILLS</small>, <em>from whence cometh his help</em>."
"<em>O my God, I will remember</em> <span class="smcap">Thee</span>!" "This is
<em>my</em> infirmity," he seems to say, when he thinks of
the weakness of his faith, and the fitfulness of his
frames and feelings: "but I will remember the
years of the right hand of the Most High. I will
remember the works of the Lord; surely I will
remember <em>Thy</em> wonders of old."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> With this key he
proceeds again to open the door of <span class="smcap">Hope</span>. And as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
he treads the valley of Achor, he "sings there as in
the days of his youth."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>In connexion with this remembrance of his God,
David alludes to some well-known places in his
Kingdom&mdash;"<em>The land of Jordan, and the Hermonites,
and the hill Mizar.</em>"</p>

<p>What means he by this reference? His language
may admit of a twofold interpretation.</p>

<p>1. He may possibly refer to his present sojourn
in the region beyond Jordan, with the Hermon
range in sight; and which had this peculiarity, that
it was beyond the old boundary-line of the Land of
Promise, making him for the time, "an alien from
the commonwealth of Israel."</p>

<p>We know from a passage in Joshua (chap. xxii.)
how sacredly the division between the covenant
people and the neighbouring tribes was preserved.
The latter were denominated a "<em>possession unclean</em>;"
the former, "<em>the land of the possession of
the Lord, wherein the Lord's tabernacle is</em>." How
bitter must it have been to a patriotic heart like
that of the Psalmist, thus to be cut off (even
though for a brief season) from all participation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
national and sanctuary blessings,&mdash;to stand outside
the land trodden by the footsteps of angels, consecrated
by the ashes of patriarchs, and over which
hovered the shadowing wings of Jehovah!</p>

<p>But he exults in the persuasion that Israel's God
is not confined to lands or to sanctuaries. "<em>I
will remember Thee</em>," says the banished monarch.
"Though wandering here beyond the region Thou
hast blest with Thy favour, I will not cease still to call
Thee and claim Thee as my God, and to recount
all the manifold tokens of Thy mercy, even though
it be from the 'land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites,
from the hill Mizar.' My foes may drive me
from my home,&mdash;they may strip me of my regal
glories,&mdash;they may make me the butt of scorn, the
mark for their arrows;&mdash;but they cannot banish me
from the better portion and heritage I have in Thy
blessed self!"</p>

<p>If we should ever be in circumstances when, like
David, we are denuded of the means of grace&mdash;shut
out from the public ministrations of the sanctuary,&mdash;or,
what is more common, placed in a disadvantageous
position for spiritual advancement;&mdash;when
our situation as regards the world, the family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
business, pursuits, companions, society, is such as
to prove detrimental to the interests of our souls,&mdash;let
us still "<em>remember God</em>!" Let the loss of
means, and privileges, and opportunities, and congenial
intercourse, draw us nearer the Source of all
knowledge, and peace, and true joy. If the starlight
be wanting, let us prize the sunlight more.
If the streams fail, let us go direct to the fountainhead.</p>

<p>Yes, and God can make His people independent
of all outward circumstances. In the court of an
Ethiopian Queen there was a believing Treasurer.
In the household of Nero there were illustrious
saints. Down in the depths of the briny ocean, imprisoned
in the strangest of tombs, a disobedient
prophet "remembered God," and his prayer was
heard. Joseph was torn away from the land of
his birth, and the home where his piety had been
nurtured, but in Egypt "<em>the Lord was with Joseph</em>."
"At my first answer," says the apostle of the Gentiles,
"no <em>man</em> stood with me, but all <em>men</em> forsook
me.... Notwithstanding, <span class="smcap">the Lord</span> stood by me,
and strengthened me." Comforting thought! that
the true Sanctuary, of which all earthly ones are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the shadowy type, is ever near: God himself, the
refuge and dwelling-place of His people to all generations,
and who, wherever we are, can turn the
place of forlorn exile&mdash;our "land of Jordan, the
Hermonites, the hill Mizar"&mdash;into scenes bright
with manifestations of His covenant love.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>2. But the references to these several localities
may admit of a different interpretation. David
may be reverting to some memorable epochs in his
past history&mdash;some green spots in the waste of
memory, where he enjoyed peculiar tokens of God's
grace and presence.</p>

<p>We spoke in last chapter of <em>Hope's</em> picture-gallery.
<em>Memory</em> has one, stranger still&mdash;filled
with landscapes of imperishable interest! Who
has not such a gallery in his own soul? Let
Memory withdraw her folding-doors&mdash;and what do
we see? The old homes of cherished infancy may
be the first to crowd the walls and arrest the eye;&mdash;scenes
of life's bright morning, the sun tipping
with his rising beam the dim mountain-heights of
the future! In the foreground, there is the murmuring
brook by which we wandered, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
umbrageous tree under which we sat;&mdash;countenances
glowing with smiles are haunting every walk and
greeting us at every turn&mdash;the ringing laugh of
childhood at some&mdash;venerable forms bending at
others.</p>

<p>But more hallowed remembrances crowd the canvas.
Ebenezers and Bethel-stones appear conspicuous
in the distance&mdash;mute and silent memorials,
amid the gray mists of the past, which read a lesson
of encouragement and comfort in a desponding and
sorrowful present.</p>

<p>David thus trod the corridors of memory. When
the future was dark and louring, he surveys picture
by picture, scene by scene, along the chequered
gallery of his eventful life! With Jordan at his
feet, the Hermon range in the distance, and some
<em>Mizar</em>&mdash;some "<em>little hill</em>" (as the word means)&mdash;rising
conspicuous in view, he dwells on various
signal instances of God's goodness and mercy in
connexion with these localities&mdash;"I will remember
Thee" (as it may be rendered) "<em>regarding the
land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the
hill Mizar</em>."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<p>We know the other names to which he here
adverts, but what is this "<span class="smcap">hill Mizar?</span>" The
answer can only be conjectural. It may be some
small mountain eminence among the hills of Judah
associated with the experiences of his earlier days.
May not memory possibly have travelled back to
the old home and valleys of Bethlehem, and lighted
perchance on the green slope where the youthful
champion measured his prowess with the lion and
the bear. As the soldier reverts with lively interest
to his first battle-field, so may not the young
Shepherd-Hero have loved to dwell on this Mizar
hill, where the God he served gave him the earnest
of more momentous triumphs?</p>

<p>Or, to make one other surmise, may it more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
likely refer to "<em>the little hill</em>" he most loved,&mdash;the
home of his thoughts, the earthly centre of his
affections, the glory of his kingdom, the joy of the
whole earth&mdash;"<em>Mount Zion</em>, on the sides of the
north, the city of the great King?"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> We find
Zion spoken of by him emphatically as "a <em>little
hill</em>." In one of the sublimest of all his Psalms, he
represents the other loftier mountains of Palestine,&mdash;Bashan
with its forests of oak, Carmel with its
groves of terebinth, Lebanon with its cedar-clad
summits,&mdash;as looking with envy at the tiny eminence
amid the wilds of Judah which God had chosen as
the place of His sanctuary: "<em>Why look ye with
envy, ye high hills? this is the hill where God
desireth to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell in it
for ever.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Is the hypothesis a forced or unlikely
one, that, in this his season of sore depression and
sorrow, he loved to linger on manifold experiences
of God's faithfulness associated with <em>Zion</em>,&mdash;its
tabernacle, its festivals, its joyous multitudes&mdash;his
own palace, that crowned its rocky heights, where
his harp was oft attuned and his psalms composed
and sung, and in which midnight found him rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and giving "thanks to God because of His righteous
judgments?" In the mind of the Sweet Singer of
Israel, might not "glorious things" have been
thought as well as "spoken of thee, O city of God?"</p>

<p>But, after all, we need not limit the interpretation
to any special locality. The speaker's past history,
from the hour when he was taken from the sheepfolds
till now, was crowded with Mizars&mdash;hill-tops
gleaming in the rays of morning. The valley of
Elah, the wood of Ziph, the forest of Hareth, the
streets of Ziklag,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> the caves of Adullam and Engedi,&mdash;all
would recall some special memorial of God's
delivering hand. He resolves to take the goodness
and mercy vouchsafed in the past, as pledges that
He would still be faithful who had promised to
"David His servant," "My faithfulness and my
mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall
his horn be exalted."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> "Thou who <em>hast</em> delivered
my soul from death, wilt not thou deliver my feet
from falling, that I may walk before God in the
light of the living?"<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The saints of God, in every age, have delighted to
dwell on these memorable spots and experiences in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
their past pilgrimage. <em>Abraham</em> had <em>his</em> "hill
Mizar" between Bethel and Hai. "<em>There,</em>" we read,
"<em>he builded an altar, and called upon the name of
the Lord.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> On his return from Egypt he retraced
his steps to the <em>same</em> locality. Why? Because it
was doubly hallowed to him now, with these former
experiences of God's presence and love. It is
specially noted that "he went on his journeys from
the south <em>even to Bethel</em>, unto the place where his
tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and
Hai; <em>unto the place of the altar, which he had
made there at the first</em>: and <small>THERE</small> he called on the
name of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>



<p><em>Jacob's</em> "Mizar" would doubtless be his ladder-steps
at Bethel, where the fugitive wanderer was
gladdened with a vision of angels, and the voice of a
reconciled God. <em>Moses</em> would think of <em>his</em> "Mizar"
either in connexion with the burning bush or the
cleft of the rock, or the Mount of Prayer at Rephidim.
<em>Isaiah's</em> "Mizar" would be the vision of
the Seraphim, when his faithlessness was rebuked,
and confidence in God restored. <em>Jeremiah</em> tells us
specially of <em>his</em>&mdash;some memorable spot where he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
a peculiar manifestation of God's presence and grace.
"<em>The Lord hath appeared of</em> <span class="smcap">old</span> <em>unto me, saying,
Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love:
therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Or shall we look to the New Testament? The
<em>Roman Centurion</em> would remember as his Mizar-height,
the spot at Capernaum where mingled Omnipotence
and Love uttered the healing word. The
<em>Magdalene</em> would remember as hers, the Pharisee's
banquet-hall, where she bathed the feet of her Lord
with a flood of penitential tears. The <em>Maniac of
Gadara</em> would recall as his, the heights around Tiberias,
where the demon-throng were expelled, and
where he sat calm and peaceful at the feet of the
Great Restorer. The <em>Woman of Samaria</em> would
remember as hers, the well of Sychar, where her
Pilgrim Lord led her from the earthly to the eternal
fountain. <em>Peter</em> would remember as his, the early
morn, and the solitary figure on Gennesaret's shore.
The <em>Sisters of Lazarus</em>, go where they might,
would recall as their hallowed memorial-spot, the
home and the graveyard of <em>Bethany</em>. <em>Paul of
Tarsus</em> would ever remember as his, the burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
plain near Damascus, where a light, brighter than
the mid-day sun, brought him helpless to the ground,
and a voice of mingled severity and gentleness
changed the persecutor into a believer&mdash;the lion
into a lamb. <em>John</em>, the beloved disciple, as he
trod the solitary isle of his banishment, or with the
trembling footsteps of age lingered in his last
home at Ephesus&mdash;John would recall as the most
sacred and hallowed "<em>Mizar</em>" of all, the gentle
bosom on which he leant at supper!</p>

<p>And who among us have not their "Mizars" still?
It has often been said that, next to the Bible, there
is no book so instructive as that volume which all
God's people carry about with them&mdash;the volume
of their own experience.</p>

<p><em>That</em> is my earliest and fondest "Mizar," says one,
the mother's knee where I first lisped my Saviour's
name, and heard of His love. Mine, says another,
is that never-to-be-forgotten sermon, when God's
messenger reasoned of righteousness, temperance,
and a judgment to come; when conviction was first
flashed on my torpid mind, and peace brought to my
troubled soul! Mine, is another's testimony, is that
bed of sickness on which I awoke from the long life-dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of indifference, and gave heed for the first
time to the things which belong to my peace. Mine,
says another, is that chamber&mdash;that closet of devotion&mdash;(alas!
too long and guiltily neglected) hallowed
and associated with a renewed consecration to
God, and with manifold tokens of His grace and
goodness. That hour of resisted temptation, says
another, is the "Mizar" on whose summit my stone
of gratitude is raised;&mdash;when I was trembling on the
edge of some precipice, and God's hand interposed
and plucked me as a brand from the burning. That
awful bereavement is mine, says still another, which
tore up my affections by the root, and led me to seek
in God, the heritage and portion which no creature-blessing
could bestow. It seemed at the time to
bode nothing but anger, but I see it now the appointed
herald of mercy sent to open up everlasting
consolations. That solemn death-bed is mine,
says another, when I saw for the first time the
reality of gospel hope in the departing Christian,
the sweet smile of a foretasted heaven playing upon
the lips, as if the response to the angel-summons,
"Come up hither!"</p>

<p>It is well for all of us, and especially in our seasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of depression and sorrow, thus to retraverse life, and
let our eyes fall on these Mizar-hills of God's faithfulness.
In seasons of spiritual depression, when
apt in our sinful despondency to distrust His mercy,
and question our own personal interest in the covenant;&mdash;when
tempted to say with Gideon, "If the
Lord be with us, why has all this befallen us?"&mdash;how
encouraging to look back, through the present
lowering cloud, on former instances and memorials
of Jehovah's favour, when we had the assured sense
of His presence; and with an eye resting on these
Mizar-hills on which He "appeared of old to us,"
disappointing our fears, and more than realizing our
fondest hopes,&mdash;to remember, for our comfort, that
having "loved us at the beginning," He will love us
"even to the end!" If we can rest on one indubitable
token of His mercy in the past, let it be to us a
Covenant-keepsake, a sweet and precious token and
pledge, that, "though for a small moment He may
have forsaken us," yet that "with great mercy He
will gather us," and that "with everlasting kindness
He will have mercy upon us."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Why not thus seek, in the noblest sense of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
word, to rise above our trials, and perplexities, and
sorrows, by taking the bright side of things. There
are two windows in every soul. The one looks out
on a dreary prospect,&mdash;lowering clouds, barren wilds,
bleak, sullen hills, pathways overgrown with rank
and noxious weeds. The other opens on what
is bright and beauteous,&mdash;sunny slopes, verdant
meadows, luscious flowers, the song of birds. Many
there are who sit always at the former&mdash;gazing
on the dark side of things, nursing their sorrows,
brooding over their trials. They can see nothing
but Sinai and Horeb&mdash;the trail of serpents and the
lair of wild beasts. Others, with a truer gospel-spirit,
love, with hopeful countenance, to watch the
breaking of the sunbeam in the darkened sky.
Like Paul, they seat themselves at the bright lattice,
saying, "<em>Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again I
say, rejoice.</em>" Both look on identically the same
landscape. But the one descry only dull heaths and
moors draped in sombre hue. The others see these
glorified with sunlight. The one gaze on nothing
but inky skies and drenching torrents. The others
behold the bow of heaven arching the sky, and the
rain-drops glittering like jewels on leaf, and grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and flower. The one can descry only "Hill Difficulties"
and "Doubting Castles." The others love to
gaze on Hermons and Mizars, on "the Palace of the
Beautiful,"&mdash;the land of Beulah;&mdash;and, bounding
the prospect, the towers and streets of the Celestial
City. They are ready to acknowledge that, however
many may have been their tribulations, their mercies
are greater and more manifold still;&mdash;that however
many the shadowy valleys, the bright spots outnumber
the dreary.</p>

<p>Are any who read these pages cast down by
reason of trouble, and perplexity, and sorrow? Is
God's hand lying heavily upon you&mdash;are you in
darkness, and in the deeps? Seek to lift the eye of
faith to <em>Him</em>. Seasons of trial must either bring
us nearer <em>to</em> Him, or drive us further <em>from</em> Him.
It is an old saying, "Affliction never leaves us as it
finds us." It either leads us to "<em>remember</em> God,"
or to banish and <em>forget</em> Him. How many there
are (and how sad is their case) who, when Providence
seems to frown,&mdash;when their hearts are smitten
like grass, their cherished hopes blighted, their
gourds withered,&mdash;are led, in the bitterness of their
spirits, to say, "My soul is cast down within me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
<em>therefore</em>, I will pine away in disconsolate sorrow.
I will rush to ruin and despair. My lot is hard,
my punishment is greater than I can bear;&mdash;all that
made life happiness to me has perished;&mdash;<small>THEREFORE</small>,
I will harden my heart. I do well to be
angry, even unto death. Existence has no charm
for me. I long to die&mdash;my only rest will be the
quiet of the grave!"</p>

<p>Sorrowing one! be yours a nobler philosophy.
Look back from these valleys of death and tribulation,
to the gleaming summits of yonder distant
<em>Mizar hills</em>! Mark, in the past, the tokens and
memorials of unmistakeable covenant love. "Call
to remembrance your song" in former nights.
Wounded Hart! on the hills of Gilead, forget not
thy former pastures. Go! stricken and smitten,
with the tears in thine eyes, bathe thy panting
sides in the cooling "water-brooks." When the
disturbers of thy peace have gone, and when hushed
again is thy forest home, return to "<em>the mountain
of myrrh and the hill of frankincense</em>." Go,
minstrel monarch of Judah, weeping exile! seat
thyself on some rocky summit on these ridges
of Hermon, and, surveying mountain height on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
mountain height, in the land of covenant promise,&mdash;each
associated with some hallowed memory,&mdash;take
down thy harp, and sing one of thine own songs of
Zion. "<em>Thou who hast shewed me great and sore
troubles shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring
me up again from the depths of the earth!</em>"<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The storm-struggle in the soul of the Psalmist is
now at its height. In the previous verse, he had
penetrated through the mists of unbelief that were
surrounding him, and rested his eye on the Mizar
hills of the Divine faithfulness in a brighter past.
But the sunshine-glimpse was momentary. It has
again passed away. His sky is anew darkened&mdash;rain-clouds
sweep the horizon&mdash;"<em>Deep calleth unto
deep at the noise of thy water-spouts.</em>" Amid the
environing floods he exclaims, "<em>All thy waves and
thy billows have gone over me!</em>"</p>

<p>The figure is a bold and striking one. Some
have thought it has reference to the sudden rush
of water-torrents from the heights of Lebanon and
Hermon;&mdash;that it was suggested by the roaring
cataracts at his feet&mdash;Jordan with its swollen and
winding rapids&mdash;the faithful picture of the deep-worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
channels in his own spirit&mdash;fretted and furrowed
with the rush of overwhelming sorrow.</p>

<p>But the word rendered "<em>deep</em>," is, in the original
Hebrew, more applicable to the floods of the
<em>ocean</em> than to the rapids of a river; and the image,
in this sense, is bolder and more expressive still.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
Billow calls on billow to sweep over the soul of
the sufferer. They lift their crested heads, and
with hoarse voice summon one another to the assault.
"Let us be confederate!" say they. "Let
us rouse the spirit of the storm! Let the windows
of heaven be opened! Let the fountains of the
great deep be broken up, that we may shake this
man's confidence in his God, and plunder faith of
her expected triumph! Ye angry tempests, driving
sleet and battering hail! come and aid us. Ye
forked lightnings, gleaming swords of the sky! leap
from your cloudy scabbards. Old ocean! be stirred
from your lowest depths. Let every wave be fretted
to madness, that with one united effort we may
effect his discomfiture and leave him a wreck on
the waters!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p>They obey the summons. Already chafed and
buffeted, they return with fresh violence to the
shock. Affliction on affliction, temptation on temptation,
roll on this lonely, surf-beaten cliff. Outward
calamities&mdash;inward troubles; his subjects in
revolt&mdash;his friends treacherous; his own son and
favourite child heading the insurrection; he himself
an exile, haunted with the thought of past sins that
were now exacting terrible retribution;&mdash;and worse
than all temporal calamities, the countenance of his
God averted. Affliction seemed as if it could go
no further&mdash;"<span class="smcap">All</span> <em>thy waves and thy billows have
gone over me!</em>"</p>

<p>We believe there are periods in the history of
most of God's people corresponding to the awful
experience recorded in this verse. Few there are
who cannot point to some sad and memorable
epochs alike in their natural and spiritual being,&mdash;some
solemn and critical crisis-hours, in which
they have been subjected to special and peculiar
trials;&mdash;encompassed with the thunders and lightnings
of Sinai&mdash;the trumpet sounding long and loud:&mdash;or,
to revert to the simile of the Psalm, when the
moorings of life have been torn away, and they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
been left to drift, on a starless, tempestuous ocean.
Often, as with David, there may at such times be a
combination of trials,&mdash;sickness&mdash;bereavement&mdash;loss
of worldly substance&mdash;estrangement of friends&mdash;blighting
of fair hopes. Then, following on these,
and worse than all, hard thoughts of God. We see
the wicked around prospering,&mdash;vice apparently
pampered,&mdash;virtue apparently trodden under foot,&mdash;many
passing through life without an ache or trial&mdash;their
homes unrifled&mdash;their hearts unwounded&mdash;their
every plan prospering&mdash;fortune smiling benignantly
at every turn; while <em>we</em> seem to have been a
target for the arrows of misfortune,&mdash;tempted with
Jeremiah to say, "<em>I am</em> <small>THE</small> <em>man who have seen
affliction by the rod of His wrath</em>."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> And doubting
a God of <em>providence</em>, the next step is to doubt a
God of <em>grace</em>. We begin to question our interest
in the covenant,&mdash;to wonder whether, after all, our
hopes of heaven have been a delusion and a lie.
God's mercy we imagine to be "gone for ever." He
seems as if He would be "favourable no more."
There is no comfort in prayer&mdash;no brightness in the
promises; the Bible is a sealed book;&mdash;the heavens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
have become as brass and the earth as iron! Oh,
so long as we had merely <em>external</em> trials, we could
brave and buffet the surrounding floods. So long as
we had the Divine smile, like the bow in the cloud,
resting upon us, we could gaze in calmness on
the blackest sky;&mdash;yea, rejoice in trial, as only unfolding
to us more of the preciousness of the Saviour.
But when we have the <em>cloud</em> without the <em>bow</em>,&mdash;when
outer trials come to a soul in spiritual unrest
and trouble,&mdash;when we harbour the suspicion that
the only Being who <em>could</em> befriend in such an hour
has Himself hidden His face,&mdash;when we have neither
this world nor the next to comfort us&mdash;smitten
hopes for time and despairing hopes for eternity!&mdash;this
is the woe of woes&mdash;the "horror of great
darkness,"&mdash;"<em>deep calleth unto deep</em>." We can say,
with a more terrible emphasis far than the smitten
patriarch, "<em>I</em> <small>AM</small> <em>bereaved</em>!"</p>

<p>The Psalmist had now reached this extremity.
It is the turning point of his present experience.
He has two alternatives before him:&mdash;either to suffer
unbelief to triumph, to distrust God, abandon
the conflict, and sink as lead in the surging
waters; or to gather up once more his spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
resources, breast the waves, and manfully buffet the
storm.</p>

<p>It is with him now, as with a sinking disciple in a
future age:&mdash;when the storm is loudest and the midnight
is darkest, the voice and footsteps of his God
are heard on the waves: "<em>And about the fourth watch
of the night, Jesus came to the disciples, walking
on the sea.</em>" "This poor man cried, and the Lord
heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles!"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>And what is the first gleam of comfort which
crests these topmost waves? It is <em>discerning the
hand and appointment of God in all his afflictions</em>!
He speaks of "<em>Thy</em> waves and <em>Thy</em> billows." These
floods do not riot and revel at the bidding of chance.
"<em>The Lord sitteth upon the water-floods.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> While,
in one sense, it aggravated his trials to think of
them as Divine chastisements&mdash;the expressions of the
Divine displeasure at sin&mdash;yet how unspeakable the
consolation that every billow rolled at the summons
of Omnipotence. "<em>The floods</em>," he can say, "<em>have
lifted up, the floods have lifted up their voice; the
floods lift up their waves. The Lord on high is
mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<em>the mighty waves of the sea.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> "<em>O Lord our God,
who is a strong Lord like unto thee? Thou rulest
the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise,
thou stillest them.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>But he could go further than this. He could
triumph in the assurance of God's returning favour;&mdash;that
behind these troubled elements there was
seated a Being of unchanging faithfulness and love.
Already the lowering mist was beginning to clear off
the mountains, and the eye of faith to descry sunny
patches of golden light gleaming in the hollows.
Soon he knew the whole landscape would be flooded
with glory. The sailor does not discredit the existence
of the beacon or lighthouse, or alter the direction
of his vessel, because the fog prevents these
being seen. Nay rather, he strains his eyes more
keenly through the murky curtain, in hopes of hailing
their guidance. When a cloud or clouds are
passing over the sun's disc, and hiding it from view,
the sunflower does not, on account of the momentary
intervention, hang its head, or cease to turn in
the direction of the great luminary. It keeps still
gazing upwards with wistful eye, as if knowing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the clouds will soon roll past, and that it will ere long
again be bathed in the grateful beams! So it was
with David. He felt that the countenance of his
God, though hidden, was not eclipsed. This pining
flower on the mountains of Gilead does not droop
in the anguish of unbelief, when "the Sun of his
soul" is for the moment obscured. He knew that
there would yet arise "light in the darkness." Amid
the roll of the billows&mdash;the moaning of the blast&mdash;he
listens to celestial music. Its key-note is "<em>the
loving-kindness</em>" of his <em>God</em>. While the heavens are
still black, and the tempest raging, he lifts the voice
of faith above the war of the storm, and thus sings:&mdash;"<em>Yet
the Lord will command his loving-kindness
in the day-time, and in the night his song
shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of
my life!</em>"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Yet</span> <em>the Lord</em>!" The believer, even in his
deepest and darkest season of trouble, has always
<em>this</em> alternative word&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Yet</span> <em>the Lord will</em>!" I
am sunk in sore trial&mdash;"<em>Yet</em> the Lord" will be
faithful to His promises! I have been bereaved of
those near and dear to me&mdash;"<em>Yet</em> the Lord" will be
to me a name better than that of son or daughter!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
I have been laid for long years on this couch of suffering&mdash;"<em>Yet</em>
the Lord" has converted this lonely
sick-chamber into the vestibule of heaven. I have
been tossed and harassed with countless spiritual
temptations&mdash;"<em>Yet</em> the Lord" will not suffer these
temptations to go further than I am able to bear.
I am soon to walk through the dark valley&mdash;"<em>Yet</em>"
will "I fear no evil, for <em>Thou</em> art with me!"</p>

<p>The Psalmist's assurance of deliverance was indeed
the test of no meagre faith. We know well, how
apt we are to be influenced and affected by present
circumstances. When all is bright, and genial,
and prosperous,&mdash;amid a happy home and kind
friends,&mdash;in the midst of robust health and flourishing
worldly schemes, the buoyant heart is full of
elasticity. The joy <em>without</em>, imparts an <em>inner</em> sunshine.
A man is happy and hopeful in spite of
himself. But if all at once he is plunged into a
vortex of trouble,&mdash;if clouds gather and thicken
around,&mdash;the mind not only becomes the prey of
its own trials, but it peoples the future with
numberless imaginary evils, and its very remaining
joys and blessings become tinged and sicklied over
with the predominating sadness! It could as little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
be expected, on natural principles, that the heart
could in such circumstances be hopeful and rejoicing,
as to expect that the outer landscape of
nature would glow and sparkle with beauty, if the
clouds of heaven obscured the great fountain of
light.</p>

<p>But faith, strong in God's word, can triumph
over natural obstacles. It did so in the case of
this afflicted exile. He remembered how his God
had vouchsafed past deliverances, even when he least
expected them;&mdash;"<em>They looked unto</em> <span class="smcap">Him</span> <em>and were
lightened</em>"<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> [literally, "their countenances were
made bright."] He feels assured that the same
loving-kindness will be "commanded" still. He sees
God's covenant faithfulness resting calmly and beautifully,
like the rainbow-tints in the spray of the
cataract! "<em>Who is among you that feareth the
Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that
walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him
trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his
God.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>This experience we have been considering is that
of Christ's people only. But there is an experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
sadder still: that of those who are living "without
God," and therefore "without hope;"&mdash;the billows
heaving, and yet they knowing not of them;&mdash;"deep
calling to deep," yet they ignorant alike of their
guilt and danger! There is nothing more sad or
touching in the midst of a storm,&mdash;when the vessel
is reeling on the waves, and little expectation of
safety is left,&mdash;than to see, amidst the settled
gloom of despair, the little child playing on the
deck, all unaware of what is impending;&mdash;or, at
a time of heart-rending bereavement, when every
face of the household is muffled in sadness and
suffused with tears, to hear the joyous laugh and
playful prattle of unconscious infancy. Ah! of
how many is this the position with regard to
eternity;&mdash;living heedless of their danger&mdash;the
waves of destruction ready to close over them!
Sadder far, surely, is <em>their</em> case, than all the troubles
and trials of God's most afflicted people. <em>Their</em>
waves and billows are crested with hope&mdash;"songs
in the night" come floating along the darkened
surges; but the future to the others has <em>no</em> ray of
hope, <em>no</em> midnight star, <em>no</em> divine song! There is
a time coming when, in a more awful sense, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
cry will be heard, "Deep calleth unto deep: all
Thy waves and Thy billows have gone over me!"
But there will be no after-strain&mdash;no joyous anthem
of anticipated deliverance&mdash;"Yet the Lord will
command His loving-kindness!" In vain will the
cry ascend, "My heart is overwhelmed: lead me to
the Rock that is higher than I."</p>

<p>But, blessed be God, that cry may ascend <em>now</em>&mdash;that
Rock may be fled to as a shelter <em>now</em>. Sinner!
these waves swept over the Rock of Ages, that
they might not sweep over you! Sheltered in
these crevices, you will be eternally safe. Not
one blast of the storm, not one drop of the rain-shower
of vengeance, can overtake you. When the
billows of wrath&mdash;the deluge of fire&mdash;shall roll over
this earth, safe in these everlasting clefts, you may
utter the challenge, "<em>Who shall separate me from
the love of Christ?</em>"</p>

<h3>LESSONS.</h3>

<p>In the previous chapter we spoke of the two
verses which form the turning-point in the Psalm,&mdash;the
climax of the conflict therein so strikingly described
between belief and unbelief. We referred to
the boldness and expressiveness of the figure: the
troubles of the believer, like the billows of the ocean
calling on one another to unite their strength that
they might effect his overthrow, but faith rising
triumphant above them all. At times, when all
human comfort gives way, God himself appears.
"<em>The voice of the Lord is upon the waters.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> <em>He</em>
not only "commands His loving-kindness in the day-time,"
but "<em>in</em> <small>THE NIGHT</small> <em>His song is with us</em>."
Our heavenly Parent comes in earth's darkest, most
tempestuous hours, sits by our side, sings His night-song&mdash;His
own lullaby&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Peace, be still!</span>" "<em>So
giveth He His beloved sleep!</em>"<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> God's "songs"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
sound always sweetest "<em>by night</em>"&mdash;the deep, dark
night of affliction. The nightingale's notes are
nothing by day&mdash;they would be lost in the chorus
of other birds; but when these have retired to their
nests, she prolongs her tuneful descant, and serenades,
with her warblings, the silent earth. The
world can only give <em>its</em> song <em>by day</em>. It can speak
only in the sunshine of prosperity. But "God our
Maker giveth <em>songs in the night</em>!"<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> His promises,
like the nightingale, sound most joyously, and,
like the glow-worm, shine most brightly, in <em>the
dark</em>!</p>

<p>Let us pause ere proceeding with the sequel of
the Psalm, and ponder the great lesson to be derived
from this experience of David.</p>

<p>It is, <em>to</em> <span class="smcap">trust God</span> <em>in the darkest, gloomiest
night of earthly trial</em>! To wait His own time,
and to say, when the billows are highest, "<em>Yet the
Lord will</em>"&mdash;</p>

<p>This is one great end and design of trial, to
exercise the grace of <em>patience</em>. There is nothing
God loves better than <em>a waiting soul</em>. "<em>The Lord
is good to them that wait for Him.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> "<em>I waited</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<em>patiently</em>," says David, in another Psalm, (or, as it is
literally, "I waited, waited,") "<em>for the Lord</em>, and He
inclined unto me, and heard my cry."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> "<em>I know
thy works</em>," says Jesus, speaking of old, in the
language of commendation, to His church at
Ephesus: "<em>how thou hast</em> <small>BORNE</small>, <em>and hast patience,
and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast
not</em> <small>FAINTED</small>."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> How often has our way <em>appeared</em>
to be hedged up with thorns,&mdash;as if there were no
possibility of egress! In sailing among some of
our own Highland lakes and inland seas, where
the mountains, in a thousand fantastic forms, rise
abrupt from the shore, we frequently seem to be landlocked,
and able to get no farther. Yet the vessel
pursues its serpentine course; and as we double the
first jutting promontory, the lake again expands;
the same waters appear beyond, gleaming like a
mirror of molten gold. We find what we imagined
to be an impassable barrier, is only a strait, opening
into new combinations of mountain majesty and
beauty. So is it in the Voyage of life. Often, in
its fitful turnings and windings, do we seem to be
arrested in our way;&mdash;"Hill Difficulties" rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
before us, and appearing to impede our vessel's
course;&mdash;but as faith steers onwards, impediments
vanish, new vistas and experiences of loving-kindness
open up. Where we expected to be stopped
by walls of frowning rock and barren mountains,
lo! limpid waves are seen laving the shore, and
joyful cascades are heard singing their way to the
silver strand!</p>

<p>And not only does God thus "command His
loving-kindness" in disappointing our fears, but
"in the night His song shall be with us." He
will turn the very midnights of our sorrow into
occasions of grateful praise! Yes! if not now,
we shall come yet to see the "needs be" of
every trial. We have only a partial view here
of God's dealings&mdash;His half-completed, half-developed
plan; but all will stand out in fair and
graceful proportions in the great finished Temple
of Eternity!</p>

<p>Go, in the reign of Israel's greatest King, to the
heights of the forest of Lebanon. See that noble
Cedar, the pride of its compeers, an old wrestler with
the northern blasts of Palestine! Summer loves to
smile upon it&mdash;night spangles its feathery foliage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
with dew-drops&mdash;the birds nestle on its branches&mdash;the
wild deer slumber under its shadow&mdash;the weary
pilgrim, or wandering shepherd, repose under its
curtaining boughs from the mid-day heat or from
the furious storm; but all at once it is marked out
to fall,&mdash;the old denizen of that primeval forest is
doomed to succumb to the woodman's stroke! As
we see the unsparing axe making its first gash
on its gnarled trunk&mdash;then the noble limbs stripped
of their branches&mdash;and at last the proud "Tree of
God" coming with a crash to the ground; we
exclaim against the wanton destruction&mdash;the demolition
of this noblest of pillars in the temple
of nature,&mdash;and we are tempted to cry with the
prophet, as if inviting the sympathy of every lowlier
stem&mdash;invoking inanimate things to resent the
affront&mdash;"<em>Howl, fir-tree, for the cedar has fallen!</em>"
But wait a little!&mdash;follow that gigantic trunk as the
workmen of Hiram launch it down the mountain
side,&mdash;thence conveyed in monster rafts along the
blue waters of the Mediterranean,&mdash;and last of all, behold
it set a glorious polished beam in the Temple of
God;&mdash;and then, as you see its destination,&mdash;gazing
down on the very Holy of Holies, set in the diadem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the Great King;&mdash;say, can you grudge that the crown
of Lebanon was despoiled, in order that this jewel
might have so noble a setting? That cedar stood as
a stately beam and pillar in <em>nature's</em> temple, but the
glory of the latter house was greater than the glory
of the former. How many of our souls are like these
cedars of God! His axes of trial have stripped and
bared them,&mdash;we see no reason for dealings so dark
and mysterious; but He has a noble end and object
in view&mdash;to set them as everlasting pillars and rafters
in His heavenly temple, to make them "a crown of
glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem
in the hand of our God!"</p>

<p>Or take another illustration. Go to one of our
graving-docks, where the weather-beaten vessel has
been weeks or months in the carpenter's hands. Her
started timbers are replaced, her shattered keel renewed,
the temporary props and scaffoldings have
been removed, and with her gay streamers afloat,
and her crew on deck, she stands ready and equipped
for sea. What is needed? Nothing but the opening
of the sluices, to reunite her to her old watery
element. She lies a helpless, decrepit thing, till these
dock-gates be opened, and the buoyant waves rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to clasp her anew in their embrace. It is done! But
at first all is noise, and wrath, and tumult. These
gurgling waters, discoloured with mud and sediment,
convert the noble granite basin into an inky, turgid
whirlpool. Ere long, however, the strife ceases;
the great wooden wall raises itself like a child that
has been awoke in its cradle by the voice of the
storm&mdash;the waters gradually calm and subside;&mdash;higher
and still higher is the vessel lifted, till,
amid the cheers of the crew, she passes by the
opened gates, and, with every sail spread to the
breeze, is off to new voyages in her ocean-home.</p>

<p>Child of trial! "vessel of mercy!" your God
sees meet at times to bring you into the graving-dock,
that He may put His tools upon you, and
refit and prepare you for the great voyage of
immortality. When He opens the sluices of trial,
you may see no mercy in His dealings. It may
be "deep calling to deep"&mdash;the roar and heaving
of antagonist waters; they may at first, too, stir
up nothing but the dregs and sediment of sin,&mdash;expose
the muddy pools, the deep corruptions of
the heart. But be still! He will yet vindicate
the rectitude and wisdom of His own procedure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Ere long, these surging waves will settle peacefully
around you, the shadows of heaven reflected in
their glassy surface; and better still, strengthened
and renovated by that season of trial, you will go
forth from the Graver's hands more ready to brave
the billows, grapple with the tempest, and reach at
last the haven where you would be!</p>

<p>It is <em>hard discipline</em>&mdash;the undowny pillow, the
trench-work and midnight vigils&mdash;which makes the
better soldier. The type of strength in the kingdom
of inanimate nature is not the sickly plant of the
hot-house, or the tree or bush choked in the dark
jungle; but the pine rocked by Alpine or Norwegian
tempests, or the oak mooring its roots in the
rifted rock! David would neither have been the
King nor the Saint he was, but for the caves of Adullam
and Engedi, the rocks of the wild goats, the
forest exile of Hermon and Gilead. He had to
thank <em>affliction</em> for his best spiritual graces. The
redeemed in glory are ready to tell the same. "We
would never have been here but for these storms of
'great tribulation.' But for the loss of that child&mdash;that
worldly calamity&mdash;that protracted sickness&mdash;that
cutting disappointment&mdash;that wounding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
my heart's affection&mdash;that annihilation of earthly
pride and ambition&mdash;that 'deep calling to deep'&mdash;I
would not now have been wearing this crown!"
Trials have been well compared to the winds God
employs to fill our sails and fetch us home to the
harbour of everlasting peace!<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One word of caution ere we close this chapter.
From all we have said&mdash;of "deeps" and "floods,"
storms and water-spouts, and midnight darkness&mdash;are
any to leave these pages with the feeling that
Religion is a gloomy, repulsive thing;&mdash;that the believer's
life is one of darkness and despair;&mdash;that
better far is the world's gaiety and folly&mdash;the merry
laugh of its light-hearted votaries&mdash;than a life of
sadness like this? Mistake us not! We repeat
what we have already said. The experience we
have been now considering is, in many respects,
peculiar; one of those dark passages which stand
alone in the diary of the spiritual life. <em>Religion
gloomy!</em> Who says so? Shall we take St Paul as
our oracle? What is his testimony? In all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
letters he tries to crowd as much as he can into
little space. In one of these, he has room for only
two injunctions. But instead of giving two that
are different, he prefers to repeat the <em>one</em>. It is the
emphatic tautology, "<em>Rejoice in the Lord alway:
and</em> <small>AGAIN</small> <em>I say</em>, <span class="smcap">Rejoice</span>."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Or shall we seek
a different tribunal? Go gather together all the
philosophers of antiquity&mdash;Plato, Socrates, Aristotle.
Bring together the wise men of Greece&mdash;the philosophers
of Alexandria&mdash;the sages of Rome. Ask if
their combined and collected wisdom ever solved
the doubts of one awakened soul, as have done
these leaves of this Holy Book? Which of them
ever dried the tear of widowhood as these? Which
of them ever smoothed the cheek of the fatherless
as these? Which of them ever lighted the torch
of hope and peace at the dying bed as these, and
flashed upon the departing soul visions of unearthly
joy? O pagan darkness! where was <em>thy</em> song in
the night? In the region and shadow of death,
where did <em>thy</em> light arise?</p>

<p>But <small>WE</small> have a "more sure word of prophecy, to
which we do well to take heed, as unto a light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
shining in a dark place." The Christian is <em>the</em> man
who alone can wear the sunny countenance. The
peace of God, keeping the heart within, cannot fail
to be mirrored in the look and life without! And if
(as often is the case) he has his appointed seasons
of trial&mdash;the sea of life swept with storms of great
tribulation&mdash;it is with him as with yonder ocean.
To the eye of the young voyager, gazing on its
mountain billows, it would seem as if its lowest
caverns were stirred, and the world were rocking to
its foundations; while, after all, it is only a surface-heaving!
There are deeps, unfathomed deeps, of
calm rest and peace, down in that ocean's undisturbed
recesses.</p>

<p>Believer in Jesus! with all thy trials, thou art a
happy man. Go on thy way rejoicing. Tribulation
may fret and ruffle the calm of thy outer life,
but nothing can touch the deeps of thy nobler being.
Troubles may rise, and "terrors may frown," and
"days of darkness" may fall around thee, but
"<em>Thou wilt keep him, O God</em>, <small>IN PERFECT PEACE</small>
<em>whose mind is stayed on</em> <span class="smcap">Thee</span>!"</p>

<h2>XI.</h2>

<h3>FAITH AND PRAYER.</h3>

<p>Touching was that scene which occurred three
thousand years ago on the borders of Palestine:
aged Naomi, in returning to the land of her own
kindred from her sojurn in Moab, pausing to take
a last farewell of her two loving daughters-in-law!
One of these refuses to part from her. Strong may
be the inducement to Ruth to return to the home
of her childhood, and, above all, to the spot where
hallowed dust reposes (the buried treasure of her
young affections). But ties stronger than death
link her soul to the one who had shared for ten
years her joys and sorrows. With impassioned
tears, she announces her determination! Her resolve
may entail upon her manifold sacrifices. She
may be going to an alien people&mdash;to a home of
penury&mdash;to bleak and barren wilds, compared with
her own fertile vales. But she is ready for any
toil, any self-denial, if only permitted to retain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the companionship of that living, loving heart,
which had been to her all that earthly tenderness
could be.</p>

<p>Such, if we may compare an earthly with a
heavenly affection, were the feelings of the banished
King of Judah, at this time towards his God. All
the temptations that have been assailing him have
not repressed the ardour of his faith, or diminished
the fervour of his love. Unbelief had done its best
to sever the holy bond which linked him to his
Heavenly Friend; but, like the tender-hearted
Moabitess from whom he sprung, he will submit to
any privation rather than be parted from Him
whose favour is life. "Entreat me not to leave
Thee," is the spirit at least of his fervid aspiration;
"nor to return from following after Thee. Where
Thou goest I will go, and where Thou dwellest I
will dwell; and death itself shall not separate between
Thee and me." As Peter, in a future age,
rushed to the feet of that Saviour he had again and
again wounded, so these many waters (the "deep
calling to deep") cannot quench the Psalmist's love,
nor many floods drown it. The voice of malignant
taunt and scorn, "Where is now thy God?" might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
have driven others to despair; but it only rouses
him up, in the midnight of his struggle, to the
exercise of new spiritual graces. "I shall not," he
seems to say, "surrender my holy trust; I know
the graciousness of the God with whom I have to
deal. Nothing will tempt me to abandon my
interest in the covenant. I shall take a new
weapon from the Divine armoury; with it I shall
seek to decide the conflict. No gibes of the scoffer,
no rebellious son, no crafty Ahithophel, can rob me
of the privilege of <span class="smcap">Prayer</span>." "<em>I will say unto
God my Rock, Why hast Thou forgotten me? why
go I mourning because of the oppression of the
enemy?</em>"</p>

<p>It is, then, a combined exercise of <em>faith</em>, and
<em>prayer</em>, on the part of David, we are now called
to consider. Out of weakness he is made strong,
waxes valiant in fight, and turns to flight the armies
of the aliens.</p>

<p>Let us advert to each in their order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> regards God here under a twofold aspect.</p>

<p>1. <em>It looks to Him as an</em> <span class="smcap">immutable God</span>.</p>

<p>Amid the fitfulness of his own feelings, this
was the Psalmist's consolation&mdash;"<em>God my</em> <span class="smcap">Rock</span>!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
What a source of comfort is there here in the
<em>immutability</em> of Jehovah. All else around us is
unstable. External nature bears on every page
of its volume the traces of mutation. Earth has
the folds already on its vesture&mdash;the wrinkles of
age on its brow. The ocean murmurs of change,
as its billows chafe on altered landmarks. Human
friendships and human associations are all fluctuating.
So are our habits, and tastes, and employments.
The old man looking back from some
hoary pinnacle on the past, almost questions his personal
identity; and these emptied chairs!&mdash;these
faces, once glowing at our firesides, now greeting
our gaze only in mute and silent portraits on the
wall! "Here we have no continuing city," is the
oracle of all time.</p>

<p>"<em>But</em> <span class="smcap">Thou</span> <em>art the same, and Thy years shall
have no end.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> "Heaven and earth may pass
away," but there is no change, and <em>can</em> be none,
in an all-perfect God! "The wheel turns round,
but the axle is immutable." The clouds which
obscure the sun do not descend from heaven&mdash;they
are exhaled from earth. It is the soul's own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
darkening vapours, generated by unbelief and sin,
which at times taint and obscure the moral atmosphere.
Behind every such murky haze He shines
brightly as ever. "<em>Hast thou not known? hast
thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord,
the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth
not, neither is weary?</em>"<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> "Young sailors," says
Rutherford, "imagine the shore and land moving,
while it is they themselves all the while. So we
often think that God is changing, when the change
is all with ourselves!"</p>

<p>2. <em>Faith regards this immutable God as a God
in covenant.</em></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> <em>Rock</em>!" Believer! you have the same immovable
ground of confidence! Look to <small>YOUR</small> God
in Christ, who has made with you "<em>an everlasting
covenant, ordered in all things, and sure</em>!" He,
"<em>willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs
of promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed
it by an oath: that by two immutable
things, in which it was impossible for God to
lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have
fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
<em>before us</em>."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The torch may flicker in your hand,
the flame may be the sport of every passing gust
of temptation and trial, but He who lighted it
will not suffer it to be quenched. "<em>Simon, Simon,
Satan hath desired to have thee, that he may sift
thee as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that
thy faith fail not.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The Great Adversary may
attempt to rob you of your peace, but that peace
is imperishably secured. He must first destroy
<span class="smcap">the Rock</span>, before he can touch one trembling soul
that has fled there for refuge! He must first uncrown
Christ, before he can touch one jewel in
the purchased diadems of His people! Your life
is "hid with Christ in God;" because He lives,
"ye shall live also!" God himself must become
mutable, and cease <em>to be God</em>, ere your eternal
safety can be imperilled or impaired. "If we
perish," says Luther, "Christ perisheth with us."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us turn now to the Psalmist's <span class="smcap">Prayer</span>.</p>

<p>If <em>Faith</em> be called the eye, <em>Prayer</em> may be
called the wings of the soul. No sooner does
Faith descry God his "<span class="smcap">Rock</span>," than forthwith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Prayer spreads out her pinions for flight. In the
close of the preceding verse, (when in the extremity
of his agony,) David had announced his determination
to betake himself to supplication&mdash;"<em>In
the night His song shall be with me, and my
prayer unto the God of my life.</em>" He follows
up his resolution now with material for petition.
He puts on record a solemn and beautiful liturgy&mdash;"<em>I
will say unto God my Rock, Why hast Thou
forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the
oppression of the enemy? As with a sword in
my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they
say daily unto me, Where is thy God?</em>"</p>

<p>How wonderfully does God thus overrule His
darkest dispensations for the exercise and discipline
of His people's spiritual graces! In their overflowing
prosperity they are apt to forget Him. He
sends them afflictions. Trial elicits faith&mdash;faith
drives to prayer&mdash;prayer obtains the spiritual blessing!
It was the sense of want and wretchedness
which drove the prodigal to cry, "Father, I have
sinned!" It was the "buffeting" thorn which sent
Paul thrice to his knees in the agony of supplication,
and brought down on his soul a rich heritage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of spiritual blessing. It was these surging waves&mdash;the
"deep calling to deep"&mdash;which elicited
the cry from this sinking castaway, "<em>My heart
is overwhelmed: lead me to the</em> <span class="smcap">Rock</span> <em>that is
higher than I!</em>" "<span class="smcap">Behold he prayeth!</span>" That
announcement seems in a moment to turn the tide
of battle, and change the storm into a calm. Well
has a Christian poet written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">"Frail art thou, O man, as a bubble on the breaker;</div>
<div class="line">Weak, and govern'd by externals, like a poor bird caught in the storm:</div>
<div class="line">Yet thy momentary breath can still the raging waters;</div>
<div class="line">Thy hand can touch a lever that may move the world."</div>
</div></div>

<p>The struggle till now may have seemed doubtful;
"<em>but they that</em> <small>WAIT</small> <em>upon the Lord shall renew
their strength; they shall mount up with wings
as eagles</em>."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> It is said, the beautiful plumage of
the Bird of Paradise not only impedes its flight
when flying against the wind, but often in the
ineffectual effort it is brought helpless and exhausted
to the ground&mdash;its golden hues soiled and
ruffled. When, however, a gentle breeze springs
up, it spreads out its feathers in a fan-like shape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and is borne joyously along! So with the believer.
When he is called to do battle with unbelief, the
wings of faith are often soiled, and mutilated, and
broken; he falls a helpless thing to the earth.
But when God's own south wind blows, he spreads
out his glorious plumage, and, rising on the pinions
of prayer, is borne onwards and upwards to the
region of heavenly peace and joy!</p>

<p>There are one or two characteristics in David's
prayer worthy of note, with which we shall sum
up this chapter.</p>

<p>1. Observe his <small>INSTANT</small> <em>resort to the "God of
his life!"</em></p>

<p>No sooner does the thought of prayer suggest
itself, than he proceeds to the sacred exercise.
Like the prodigal, not only does he say, "<em>I will
arise and go</em>," but the next record in his history is,
"<em>And he arose, and came to his Father</em>."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Oh,
how much spiritual benefit we miss by procrastination!
The cloud of blessing floats over our heads,
but we fail to stretch forth the electric rod of
prayer to fetch it down! We determine on embarking,
but, by guilty delay, we allow the vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to weigh anchor, and we are left behind. Many
an afflictive dispensation thus loses its sanctifying
design. When the heart is crushed and broken,
the heavenly voice sounds startling and solemn!
What a season, if timeously improved, for enrichment
at the mercy-seat! When "things present" are
disenchanted of their spell,&mdash;when time is brought
to hold its relative insignificance to eternity, what
a season for the self-emptied one, to go to the all-fulness
of Jesus, and receive from Him every
needful supply! But, alas! we often know not
"the day of our merciful visitation." The heart,
when the hammer might be falling on it, and
welding it to the Divine will, is too often suffered
to cool. Solemn impressions are allowed to wear
away,&mdash;the blessing is lost by guilty postponement.
David might now have been so absorbed in his
trials, as to have lost the opportunity of prayer.
He might have invented some vain excuses for
procrastination, and missed the blessing; just as
the disciples, by their sluggish indifference and
guilty slumber, drew down the thrice-repeated rebuke
from injured Goodness, "<em>Could ye not watch
with me one hour?</em>" But the golden moment is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
not suffered by him thus to pass. No sooner does
he get a glimpse of the path of prayer, than he
proceeds to tread it. The very fact of the fire
being so low, is the most powerful reason for
stirring it. Her Lord being lost, is the strongest
argument for the Spouse seeking Him without delay;&mdash;"<em>I
will rise now, and go about the city in the
streets, and in the broad ways I will seek Him
whom my soul loveth.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>2. Observe David's <em>importunity</em>. He waxes
into a holy boldness. He seeks to know from
"the God of his life" the reasons of this apparent
desertion&mdash;"'<em>Why hast Thou forgotten me?</em>' I cannot
see or understand, as Thy covenant servant, the
reason of all this depression&mdash;why, with all those
promises of Thine, these hands should be hanging
down, and these knees be so feeble."</p>

<p>The mother does not cast off her sick or feeble
child. Its very weakness and weariness is an additional
argument for her care and love, and draws
her heart closer than ever to the bed of the tiny
sufferer! David knew well that God, who had
ever dealt with him "as one whom his mother comforteth,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
would not (unless for some wise reason)
leave him to despondency. Looking to this immutable
Covenant-Jehovah, and lifting his voice high
above the water-floods, he thus, in impassioned
prayer, pleads "the causes of his soul:"&mdash;"<em>In Thee,
O Lord, do I put my trust; let me never be
ashamed: deliver me in Thy righteousness. Bow
down Thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be
Thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to
save me. For Thou art my rock and my fortress;
therefore for Thy name's sake lead me, and guide
me. Pull me out of the net that they have laid
privily for me: for Thou art my strength. Into
Thine hand I commit my spirit: Thou hast redeemed
me, O Lord God of truth.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>3. The Psalmist <em>takes his</em> <small>SPECIAL TROUBLE</small> <em>to
God, and makes it the subject of prayer</em>. He
names in the Divine presence the cause of his deepest
perplexity. "<em>As with a sword in my bones,
mine enemies reproach me, while they say daily
unto me, Where is thy God?</em>"<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>"Generalities," says a good man, "are the death
of prayer." The loftiest privilege the believer can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
enjoy is the confidential unburdening of his wants
into the ear of a <em>Father</em>. Just as a child can
freely unbosom to a parent what he can do to no
one else, so are we permitted to tell into the ear of
our Father in heaven whatever may be the heart-sorrow
with which a stranger (often a friend) dare
not intermeddle. See the <em>speciality</em> in the Psalmist's
confession of his sin. It is not the <em>general</em>
acknowledgment of a sinner. It is rather an humbled
penitent carrying <em>one</em> deep crimson-stain to the
mercy-seat; bringing <em>it</em>, and <em>it alone</em>, as if for the
moment he had to deal respecting <em>it</em> only with the
great Heart-searcher. "<span class="smcap">My</span> <em>sin</em> is ever before me."
"I have done <em>this</em> evil in Thy sight." "Wash me
from <em>mine iniquity</em>, and cleanse me from <em>my sin</em>."
"I said, I will confess <em>my transgressions</em>, and Thou
forgavest the iniquity of <em>my sin</em>."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Let us not think that we can ever have comfort
in merging individual sins in a <em>general</em> confession.
This is the great and pre-eminent advantage
of secret closet-prayer. Social prayer and public
prayer are eminently means of securing the Divine
blessing; but it is in the quiet of the chamber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
when no eye and ear are on us but that of "our
Father that seeth in secret," that we can bring our
secret burdens to His altar,&mdash;crucify our secret sins,
acknowledge the peculiar sources of our weakness
and temptation, and get special grace to help us in
our times of need.</p>

<p>But we may here ask, Have we any assurance
that the prayers of David, at this critical emergency,
were indeed answered? Or,(as we are often tempted
in seasons of guilty unbelief to argue regarding
our prayers still,) did they ascend unheard and unresponded
to?&mdash;did the cries of the supplicant die
away in empty echoes amid these glens of Gilead?
We have his own testimony, in a magnificent ode of
his old age,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> one of the last, and one of the noblest
his lips ever sung, that Jehovah <em>had</em> heard him in
the day of his trouble. It is a Psalm, as we are
told in the title, written by him on his return to
his capital, when victory had crowned his arms, and
his kingdom was once more in peace. The aged
Minstrel takes in it a retrospective survey of his
eventful pilgrimage. Many a Mizar-hill in the long
vista rises conspicuously into view. He climbs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
thought their steeps, and erects his Ebenezer! As
his flight and sojourn beyond Jordan formed the latest
occurrence in that chequered life, we may well believe
that in uttering these inspired numbers, the
remembrance of his memorable soul-struggle there
must have been especially present to his mind.
Let us listen to his own words: "<em>The sorrows of
death compassed me, and</em> <small>THE FLOODS OF UNGODLY
MEN</small> <em>made me afraid.... In my distress I called
upon the Lord, and cried unto</em> <span class="smcap">my God</span>: <span class="smcap">He
heard</span> <em>my voice out of His temple, and</em> <span class="smcap">my cry
came before Him, even into His ears</span>." In the
sublimest poetical figures of all his Psalms, Jehovah
is further represented in this hymn of thanksgiving
as hastening with rapid flight, in august symbols
of majesty, to the relief and succour of His
servant&mdash;"bowing the heavens"&mdash;"the darkness
under His feet"&mdash;"riding upon a cherub"&mdash;"flying
upon the wings of the wind"&mdash;"sending out His
arrows, and scattering His foes"&mdash;"shooting out
lightnings"&mdash;and "discomfiting them." And with
the writer's mind still resting on the same emblems
which he uses in his Exile-Psalm,&mdash;the "deep calling
to deep"&mdash;the "noise of the water-spouts"&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
"waves and billows,"&mdash;he interweaves other references
and experiences with this unequivocal testimony
to God his "<em>Rock</em>," as the <span class="smcap">Hearer of prayer</span>,&mdash;"<em>He
sent from above, He took me, He drew me
out of many waters.... Who is God save the
Lord? or who is a</em> <span class="smcap">Rock</span> <em>save our God?... The
Lord liveth; and blessed be my</em> <span class="smcap">Rock</span>; <em>and let the
God of my salvation be exalted!</em>"<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Reader! let me ask, in conclusion, do <em>you</em> know
in your experience the combined triumphs of <em>faith
and prayer</em>&mdash;these two heavenly spies that fetch
back Eschol-clusters of blessing to the true Israel
of God? Do you know what it is, in the hour of adversity,
to repair to "the <em>Rock</em> of your strength?"
Do you believe in His willingness to hear, and in
His power to save? How sad the case of those
who, in their seasons of trial, have no refuge to
which they can betake themselves, but some fluctuating,
perishing, earthly one;&mdash;who, when they lose
the world, lose their all! The miser plundered of
his gold, cleaving to the empty coffers;&mdash;the pleasure-hunter
seeking to drain the empty chalice, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to extract honey out of the empty comb;&mdash;the
bereaved grasping with broken hearts their withered
gourd, and refusing to be comforted! The worldling
is like the bird building its nest on the topmost
bough of the tree. There it weaves its wicker
dwelling, and feels as if nothing can invade its
security and peace. By and by the woodman
comes,&mdash;lays down his axe by the root. The
chips fly off apace. The pine rocks and shivers;
in a few moments it lies prone on the forest-sward.
The tiny bird hovers over its dismantled home&mdash;the
scene of desolation and havoc&mdash;and then goes
screaming through the wood with the tale of her
woes! The Christian, again, is like the sea-fowl,
building its nest in the niches of the ocean cliff,
which bids defiance at once to the axe and the
hand of the plunderer. Far below, the waves are
lifting their crested tops, and eddying pools are
boiling in fury. The tempest may be sighing overhead,
and the wild shriek of danger and death rising
from some helpless bark that is borne like a weed
on the maddened waters. But the spent spray can
only touch these rocky heights,&mdash;no more; and the
curlew, sitting with folded wings on her young, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
look calm and undismayed on the elemental war.
"What is the best grounds of a philosopher's constancy,"
says Bishop Hall, "but as moving sands, in
comparison of the Rock that we may build upon!"</p>

<p>Yes! build in the clefts of that immoveable Rock,
and you are safe. Safe in Christ, you can contemplate
undismayed all the tossings and heavings of
life's fretful sea! So long as the Psalmist looked
to God, he was all secure. When he looked to <em>himself</em>,
he was all despondency. Peter, when his eye
was on his Lord, walked boldly on the limpid waves
of Gennesaret; when he diverted <em>it on himself</em>, and
thought on the dangers around him, and the unstable
element beneath him, "he began to sink!"</p>

<p>Believer! is your heart overwhelmed? Are you
undergoing a similar experience with the Psalmist?
Your friends (perhaps your nearest and best) misunderstanding
your trial, unable to probe the severity
of your wound, mocking your tears with unsympathising
reflections and cruel jests&mdash;"a sword
in your bones!" Turn your season of sorrow into
a season of prayer. Look up to the God-man Mediator,
the tender Kinsman within the veil! <em>He
knoweth</em> your frame. When He sees your frail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
bark struggling in the storm, and hears the cry of
prayer rising from your lips, He will say, as He
said of old, "<span class="smcap">I know</span> <em>their sorrows</em>, and I will go
down to deliver them! O wounded Hart! panting
after the water-brooks, I was once wounded
for <em>thee</em>. O smitten soul! seamed and scarred
with the lightning and tempest, see how I myself,
the Rock of Ages, was smitten and afflicted!"
Ay, and thou canst say too, "<em>God</em> <small>MY</small> <em>Rock</em>!"
Thou canst individually repose in that sheltering
Refuge, as if it were intended for thee alone.
The loving eye of that Saviour is upon thee, as
if thou wert alone the object of His gaze,&mdash;as if
no other struggling castaway breasted the billows
but thyself!</p>

<p>Blessed security, who would not prize it! Blessed
shelter, who would not repair to it! Oh that
the Psalmist's creed and resolution might be ours&mdash;"<em>I
will say of the Lord, He is</em> <span class="smcap">my Rock</span> <em>and</em>
<small>MY</small> <em>Fortress, and</em> <small>MY</small> <em>Deliverer.</em>"&mdash;"<em>O come let us
sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise to
the</em> <span class="smcap">Rock of our salvation</span>!"</p>

<h2>XII.</h2>

<h3>THE QUIET HAVEN.</h3>

<p>We have now reached the close of this instructive
Psalm&mdash;the last entry in the experience of the
Royal Exile. Here is the grand summing up&mdash;"the
conclusion of the whole matter." The curtain falls
over the scene of conflict, leaving the believer
triumphant. As he began with prayer, he now
ends with praise; as he began with weeping, he
now ends with rejoicing; as he began mourning
over the loss of his God, he ends exulting in Him as
"<em>the health of his countenance</em>." We are reminded
of the Great Apostle reaching, by successive steps
in his high argument, new altitudes of faith and
hope,&mdash;beginning with "<em>no condemnation</em>," till he
ends with "<em>no separation</em>,"&mdash;mounting with loftier
sweep and bolder pinion, till, far above the mists and
clouds of the lower valley, he can utter the challenge,
"<em>Who shall separate me from the love of Christ?</em>"<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Joyful is it when a protracted war, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
been draining a nation's resources and rifling its
homes, is drawing to a close,&mdash;when an army, amid
hostile tribes, and the more fatal ravages of a hostile
climate, has succeeded in trampling out the
ashes of rebellion, and is returning triumphant
from hard-contested fields of valour. Joyful is it
when a noble vessel, that has for long been wrestling
with the storm, enters at last the desired haven,&mdash;when
the voyagers, who for hours of anxiety and
terror have been hanging with bated breath between
life and death, can now pass the gladdening watchword
from mouth to mouth&mdash;"Thank God, we are
safe!" Joyful, too, when the tried believer, as
described in this Psalm,&mdash;"<em>persecuted, but not
forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed,</em>"&mdash;has surmounted
wave after wave, that has been threatening
to sweep him from his footing on the Rock, and
is made "more than conqueror through Him that
loved him!" The wounded Hart we found in the
opening verse bounding through the forest glades,
hit by the archers, with glazed eye and panting
sides, has now reached the coveted Water-brooks;&mdash;the
fainting soul is now drinking at the great fountainhead
of consolation and joy. We have elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
an appropriate inspired comment on the whole
Psalm, with its successive experiences: "<em>Many are
the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth
him out of them all.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>This concluding verse is so far a repetition of the
fifth; and yet, as we cursorily noted in the introductory
chapter, there is an important difference
between them, to which we may again for a moment
advert. In the former, it is on the part of the
speaker the language of faith in the midst of despondency,
expressing assurance that something
<em>will</em> be his, which he has not yet attained: "<em>Hope
thou in God; for I shall</em> <small>YET</small> <em>praise Him for the
help of His countenance</em>." In the latter, he summons
his soul to the exercise of the same hope and
confidence; but he now can exult in the realised
possession of God's favour and love&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Who is</span> <em>the
health of my countenance</em>." Nay, more, in the fifth
verse he stops with the words, "<em>my countenance</em>;"
but in the closing verse, he adds the expression of
appropriating faith and triumphant assurance. It
is the Key-stone of the arch. Two little words,
which, like the ciphers following the unit, give an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
augmented value to all that goes before!&mdash;"<span class="smcap">My
God!</span>" The two last divine expedients to which he
had resorted (faith and prayer) have not been in
vain. They have loaded the cloud of mercy, and it
bursts upon the suppliant in a shower of blessing!</p>

<p>The 22d Psalm has been referred by commentators
to this same period of exile among the mountains
of Gilead. There is much to confirm this
supposition in the general tone of the Psalm, as
well as in its incidental references. There is the
same deep, anguished depression of spirit,&mdash;words,
indeed, denoting such an intensity of sorrow, that,
though primarily applicable to David, we must look
for their true exponent in the case of a Greater
Sufferer. The challenge, "<em>Where is thy God?</em>" of
the 42d, seems echoed back in the 22d by the
mournful appeal, "<em>My God, my God, why hast
Thou forsaken me?</em>"</p>

<p>But in the latter, as in the former, (ere it closes,)
light breaks through the thick darkness. By a
similar exercise of faith and prayer, the Royal
Mourner triumphs. "<em>Deliver my soul</em>," says he,
"<em>from the sword; my darling from the power of
the dog. Save me from the lion's mouth.</em>" (Ver. 20,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
21.) The prayer is heard while he is yet speaking!
At this point of the Psalm, the language all at once
passes from complaint into exultation&mdash;from prayer
into praise; and the voice of victory rises higher
and higher, till it reaches the close. God has taken
off his sackcloth, and girded him with gladness.
He already anticipates the happy time when again
he shall be the leader of the festal throng on the
heights of Zion. "<em>Thou hast heard me</em>," is his
opening burst of triumph, "<em>from the horns of the
unicorns. I will declare Thy name unto my
brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I
praise Thee.... My praise shall be of Thee in
the great congregation: I will pay my vows before
them that fear Him</em>."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Nay, further; what Psalm succeeds the 22d? Is
it mere accidental arrangement which has given the
beautiful 23d (the best known and loved of all
David's Psalms) the immediate sequence? Is it a
mere devout imagination which leads us to regard
it (from the place it occupies in the Psalter) as the
next his hand penned and his lips sung, after these
plaintive elegies? This Song of the chosen flock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
is not, as many think, the Psalm of his boyhood,
written in the days of his innocence, with his shepherd's
crook and harp, in the Valleys of Bethlehem.
The imagery of the Psalm <em>may</em> indeed have been
taken from this sunny season of his youth. But, as
it has been suggested,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> the emblem may as likely
have been borrowed from seeing a flock of sheep in
these grassy regions reposing by "green pastures"
and "still waters"&mdash;or, at other times, wending their
way out of some "dark valley;"&mdash;one, perhaps a
timid wanderer, clenched in the arms of the shepherd,
on his way with it back to the fold!</p>

<p>We have witnessed, after a day of gloomy fog
and rain and thunder, the dense curtain that overhung
the landscape rolling away.&mdash;The clouds
break, gleaming vistas appear through their golden
linings; and the rays of the long-imprisoned sun
shine down upon ten thousand sparkling pearls on
grass and flower. The choristers of wood and
grove had till then been silent; but now are they
seen brushing the rain-drops from the branches,
and filling the air with their music, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
nature is glad again. So it is with the Great
Singer of Israel; so long as God's face is withdrawn,
his wings are folded&mdash;his melody hushed&mdash;his
harp unstrung. But when the thunder-cloud
has passed,&mdash;when, as the clear shining after rain,
the longed-for countenance again breaks forth,&mdash;when,
in answer to those prayers that were mightier
than the armies of Joab close by, his enemies
are dispersed, and the way again open to a peaceful
return to his capital,&mdash;may we not imagine
the triumphant conqueror&mdash;strong in the Lord,
and in the power of His might&mdash;making the Gilead
valleys resound with the hymn of praise?&mdash;"<em>The
Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He
maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He
leadeth me beside the still waters!</em>"<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> As he
thought of all the trying discipline to which he
had been subjected to test his faith, drive him to
prayer, and lead him to thirst more ardently for
"the living God," he could say in the retrospect,
what he was unable to do at the time&mdash;"<em>He restoreth
my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> That path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
was a rugged one&mdash;that trial a severe one&mdash;when
he was found setting out barefoot, and dim with
tears, across Mount Olivet, compelled to take
refuge beyond Jordan amid the wilds of Bashan.
But he acknowledges now that these were "<em>paths
of righteousness</em>." They were well and wisely
ordered,&mdash;the hand of his God had appointed them.
He can repeat with greater assurance his forbearing
retort to the curses of Shimei&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Let him
curse on, for the Lord hath bidden him.</span>"
Moreover, all this wilderness-experience not only
sustained him in the present&mdash;it nerved him for
the future. God's renewed faithfulness in this
trying hour was a pledge for all time to come.
He had added another Mizar-hill to former memorials
of the Divine goodness. With the prospect,
at his advanced age, of the last and terminating
trial of his pilgrimage, (the descent to the deepest
and gloomiest ravine of all,) he could, with his eye
on the guiding Shepherd, exclaim&mdash;"<em>Yea, though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy
rod and Thy staff they comfort me.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Even temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
mercies had been largely and bountifully
supplied him in the place of his exile. The powerful
chiefs of the Transjordanic tribes, as we previously
observed,&mdash;"Shobi of Ammon, and Machir,
and Barzillai of Manasseh,"&mdash;brought the rich produce
of their fields and pastures for the supply
of himself and his army. He could say&mdash;"<em>Thou
hast prepared a table before me in the presence of
mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil;
my cup runneth over.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> And now, with the prospect
before him of a joyful return to his throne,
and the still more joyous prospect of being a
worshipper in God's house on earth,&mdash;the type of
the better Temple in the skies,&mdash;he can sing, as the
closing strain of his exile&mdash;"<em>Goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life; and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Reader! is this your experience? Is this the result
of your temporal afflictions, the end of your
spiritual conflicts,&mdash;to lead you to the same Shepherd
of Israel, and to exult in Him as "the health of
your countenance, and your God?" Elimelech, of
old, was compelled by famine to leave Bethlehem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
but his name signified, "<em>My God is King!</em>" When
we are pressed with straits, and troubles, and perplexities,
let <em>us</em> make that name our strong tower!
"<span class="smcap">My God is King</span>" is a glorious motto. Is it
the heavings and convulsions of the world's nations&mdash;"kings
of the earth setting themselves,
and rulers taking counsel together," from motives
of personal ambition, or political jealousy, or lust
of conquest? Write upon all their schemes, <span class="smcap">Elimelech</span>&mdash;"<em>My
God is King!</em>" Is it the apparently
mysterious discipline through which some may
be passing&mdash;bereavements threatening your dwelling,
or the hand of death already on your loved
ones? Write on the darkened threshold, <span class="smcap">Elimelech</span>&mdash;"<em>My
God is King!</em>" Is it the prospect of your
own death that is filling you with apprehension?
Remember in whose hands, under whose sovereign
control, that messenger is. Go to the vacant
Sepulchre at Golgotha, and read that writing and
superscription which the "Abolisher of death" has
left for the comfort of all His people:&mdash;"<em>I have the
keys of the grave and of death</em>." Christian! even
here, in these gloomy regions, "<em>thy God is King!</em>"</p>

<p>How blessed thus to be able, both in temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and spiritual things, to lie in the arms of His
mercy, saying, "Undertake Thou for us!"&mdash;to feel
that every thread in the web of life is woven by
the Great Artificer,&mdash;that not one movement in
these swiftly-darting shuttles is chance; but all is
by <em>His</em> direction, and all is to result in good! In
having Himself as our portion, we are independent
of every other;&mdash;we have the pledge of all other
blessings. "Let the moveables go, the inheritance
is ours!" Let the streams fail, we have the inexhaustible
fountain! "Drop millions of gold,"
says good Bishop Hopkins, "boundless revenues,
ample territories, crowns and sceptres, and a poor
contemptible worm lays his <em>One God</em> against them
all."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> "<em>Our</em> all," says Lady Powerscourt, "is but
two mites (soul and body). <em>His</em> all&mdash;Heaven,
Earth, Eternity, Himself." We have said in a
previous chapter that the loftiest archangel can
tell of no mightier prerogative than looking up to
the Great Being before whom he casts his crown,
and saying, "My God!" <span class="smcap">We</span> can utter them in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
sense higher than he. He is <small>OUR</small> God <em>in Christ</em>.
The words to us are written (which to the unredeemed
angels they are not) in the blood of
atonement! Imagine, for a moment, a conversation
between a bright angel in heaven and a ransomed
sinner from earth. The angel can point to a past
eternity; he can tell of a glorious pedigree; he
can point up to his Almighty Maker, and say,
"He has been <em>my God</em> for ages and ages past. I
have been kept, supported, gladdened by His amazing
mercy, long before the birth of time or your
world!" "True," we may imagine the redeemed
and glorified sinner to reply,&mdash;"but I can tell of
something more wondrous still. He is <em>my God in
covenant</em>! Thou art His by <em>creation</em>, but I am
His also by <em>adoption</em>, <em>filiation</em>, <em>sonship</em>. Though
grace has kept thee through these countless ages,
during which thou hast cast thy crown at His
feet, what is the grace manifested to <em>thee</em>, in comparison
with the grace manifested to <em>me</em>? Grace
made thee holy, and kept thee holy; but grace
found me on the brink of despair, plucked me as
a brand from the burning, brought me from the
depths of woe and degradation, to a throne and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
crown! <em>Thy</em> God hath loved thee. <em>My</em> God hath
'loved <em>me</em>' and <span class="smcap">given Himself</span> <em>for me</em>!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now we close our meditations on this beautiful
and instructive Psalm:&mdash;a Psalm which, even
since we have begun to write on it, we have seen
clung to as a treasured solace in hours of sickness;&mdash;its
sublime utterances soothing the departing soul,
just as it was pluming its wings for flight to the
spirit-world! Reader! in any future dark and
troubled passages in your life, you may well with
comfort turn to this <em>diary</em> of an old and tried
saint, remembering that it records the experiences
of "the man after God's own heart." Tracing <em>his</em>
footsteps and tear-drops along "the sands of time,"
you shall cease to "think it strange concerning the
fiery trials that may be trying you, as though some
strange thing happened." You will find that "the
same afflictions are accomplished in you," which
have been "accomplished" in the case of God's
most favoured servants in every age of the Church.
Do not expect now the <em>un</em>clouded day. That is not
for earth, but for heaven. God indeed, had He
seen meet, might have ordained that your pathway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
was to be without cloud or darkness, trial or
tear;&mdash;no poisoned darts, no taunts, no contumely,
no cross, no "deep calling to deep,"&mdash;nothing but
calm seas unfretted by a ripple, sunny slopes and
verdant valleys, and bright Mizar-hills of love and
faithfulness! But to keep you humble,&mdash;to teach
you your dependence on Himself,&mdash;to make your
present existence a state of discipline and probation,
He has ordered it otherwise. Your journey
as travellers is through mist and cloud-land;&mdash;your
voyage as seamen through alternate calm
and storm.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> And much of that discipline, too,
is mysterious. You cannot discern its "why" and
"wherefore." To employ a former symbol, you are
now like the vessel building in the dock-yard.
The unskilled and uninitiated can <em>hear</em> nothing but
clanging hammers;&mdash;they can see nothing but unshapely
timbers and glare of torches. It is a scene
of din and noise, dust and confusion. But all will
at last be acknowledged as needed portions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
spiritual workmanship;&mdash;when the soul, released
from its earthly fastenings, is launched on the summer
seas of eternity&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Give to the winds thy fears,</div>
<div class="indent1">Hope and be undismay'd.</div>
<div class="line">God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears,</div>

<div class="line">Through waves, and clouds, and storms,</div>

</div></div>

<p>Above all, let this Psalm teach you that your
<em>spiritual</em> interests are in safe keeping. No wounded
Hart seeking the water-brooks ever sought them
in vain. When drooping, downcast, disconsolate
yourself, remember "God is faithful." "He cannot
deny Himself." "<em>He satisfieth the longing soul
with goodness.</em>" None is "able to pluck you out
of His hand." There may be fluctuations&mdash;ebbings
and flowings&mdash;in the tides of the soul; but "<em>He that
hath begun a good work in you, will carry it on
until the day of the Lord Jesus.</em>" You may reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the heavenly fold with bleating cries,&mdash;with torn
fleece and bleeding feet;&mdash;but you <em>will</em> reach it, if you
have learned to sing, "<em>The Lord is my shepherd!</em>"
You may reach the water-brooks with languid eye
and panting sides;&mdash;but you <em>will</em> reach them, if you
can truthfully say, "<em>My soul thirsteth for God, for
the living God!</em>" You may begin your song in
the minor-key, but if "<span class="smcap">My God</span>" be its key-note,
you will finish it with the angels and among
ministering seraphim!</p>

<p>Go then, Christians! and, as you see what <span class="smcap">Faith</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Hope</span>, and <span class="smcap">Prayer</span> did for the Exile of Gilead,
try what they can and <em>will</em> do for <em>you</em>. With all
your varied trials, with all your manifold sorrowful
experiences, who, after all (this Psalm seems to
say) so favoured as <em>you</em>? Who possess your present
exalted privileges?&mdash;who your elevating hopes?&mdash;the
consciousness, even in your trials, that each
billow is wafting you nearer the haven of eternal
rest? "<em>These see the works of the Lord, and His
wonders in the deep. For He commandeth, and
raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves
thereof. They mount up to the heaven, they go
down again to the depths: their soul is melted</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<em>because of trouble. Then they cry unto the Lord
in their trouble, and He bringeth them out of their
distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that
the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad
because they be quiet</em>; <span class="smcap">so He bringeth them
unto their desired haven</span>!"</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The title of the Psalm (&#1502;&#1513;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; <span class="smcap">Maschil</span>&mdash;<em>instruction</em>,) is the same
as that of other twelve. Some have referred the word merely to the
music&mdash;indicating the tune to which the Psalms were set,&mdash;demanding of
the sons of Korah, and "the chief musician," (the conductors of temple-song,)
some melody specially adapted to the sentiments they contain.
Others, with greater probability, take it as indicative of their <em>design</em>;&mdash;that
while expressive of personal feeling and experience, they were
intended for the "instruction" and comfort of the Church in all ages.
Hence the term given to them of <em>didactic</em>.
</p>
<p>
Though his name is not mentioned, there is little doubt that David,
and not the sons of Korah, as some have supposed, was the author of
this Psalm. The reader is referred to <em>Hengstenberg</em> for a statement of
the internal grounds, in the Psalm itself, to favour this conclusion. "To
me," says Calvin, "it appears more probable that the sons of Korah are
here mentioned because this Psalm was committed as a precious treasure
to be preserved by them;&mdash;as we know that out of the number of
the singers some were chosen and appointed to be keepers of the Psalms.
That there is no mention made of David's name, does not in itself
involve any difficulty, since we see the same omission in other Psalms,
of which there is, notwithstanding, the strongest grounds for concluding
that he was author."
</p>
<p>
According to an arbitrary division by the Jews of their Psalter into
five parts, supposed to have been made by Ezra after the return from
Babylon, the Forty-second Psalm forms the commencement of the second
book. Regarding its structure, we may remark, that it is divided into
two portions or <em>strophes</em>, each of these closing with a refrain in verses
5 and 11.</p></div>

"PerÃ¦a and the Trans-Jordanic Tribes," in which these different
references are graphically grouped together. "The PerÃ¦an hills
are the 'Pisgah' of the earlier history: to the later history they
occupy the pathetic relation that has been immortalised in the
name of 'the long ridge,' from which the first and last view of
Granada is obtained. They are the 'Last Sigh' of the Israelite
exile."&mdash;(P. 328.)</p></div>

tribute ever penned over departed worth, the "<cite>In Memoriam</cite>"
of Tennyson; or in modern song, to the exquisite
and plaintive loveliness of this very Psalm, set to music by
Mendelssohn, and so well known by the title, "<cite>As the hart

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> I refer the reader to the words quoted on the title-page.
They form the dying testimony and experience of one of the
holiest men of any age. We have seen in the possession of a
revered friend, the Bible which belonged to the great Marquis of
Argyle, and which formed his constant companion during the
period of his imprisonment. Almost every verse of the 42d
Psalm is specially marked. Some of the verses, such as the third,
are noted with a double stroke. We may well imagine him, after
closing such "an afflicted man's companion," thus writing to his
Marchioness&mdash;"They may shut me in prison where they please,
but they cannot shut out God from me."</p></div>

the range, when seen as a whole, is in the highest degree diversified
and impressive. And the wide openings in the western
hills, as they ascend from the Jordan valley, give such extensive
glimpses into the heart of the country, that not merely the
general range, but particular localities can be discovered with
ease.... From the castle of Rubad, north of the Jabbok,
are distinctly visible Lebanon, the Sea of Galilee, Esdraelon in
its full extent, Carmel, the Mediterranean, and the whole range
